tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 262.75 273.15 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I THOUGHT THIS IS HOW NATURE PAINTS A PHOTO ONE FEMTO FRAME AT A TIME BUT OF COURSE OUR EYE SEES AN INTEGRAL COMPOSITE
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 275.25 282.74 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THIS TOMATO ONE MORE TIME YOU WILL NOTICE AS THE LIGHT WASHES OVER THE TOMATO IT CONTINUES TO GLOW IT does not BECOME DARK
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 282.75 292.02 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WHY IS THAT BECAUSE THE TOMATO IS ACTUALLY RIPE AND THE LIGHT IS BOUNCING AROUND INSIDE THE TOMATO AND IT COMES OUT AFTER SEVERAL TRILLIONTHS OF A SECOND
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 292.95 302.08 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO IN THE FUTURE WHEN THIS FEMTO CAMERA IS IN YOUR CAMERA PHONE YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO GO TO A SUPERMARKET AND CHECK IF THE FRUIT IS RIPE with out ACTUALLY TOUCHING IT
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 304.08 307.59 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO HOW DID MY TEAM AT MIT CREATE THIS CAMERA
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 309.21 320.03 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> NOW AS PHOTOGRAPHERS YOU KNOW IF YOU TAKE A SHORT EXPOSURE PHOTO YOU GET VERY LITTLE LIGHT BUT {we are / we were} GOING TO GO A BILLION TIMES FASTER THAN YOUR SHORTEST EXPOSURE SO {you are / you were} GOING TO GET HARDLY ANY LIGHT
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 320.36 336.32 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO WHAT WE DO IS WE SEND THAT BULLET THOSE PACKET OF PHOTONS MILLIONS OF TIMES AND RECORD AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH VERY CLEVER SYNCHRONIZATION AND FROM THE GIGABYTES OF DATA WE COMPUTATIONALLY WEAVE TOGETHER TO CREATE THOSE FEMTO VIDEOS I SHOWED YOU
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 336.53 340.37 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND WE CAN TAKE ALL THAT RAW DATA AND TREAT IT IN VERY INTERESTING WAYS
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 341.25 342.7 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO SUPERMAN CAN FLY
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 343.02 352.09 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SOME OTHER HEROES CAN BECOME INVISIBLE BUT WHAT ABOUT A NEW POWER FOR A FUTURE SUPERHERO TO SEE AROUND CORNERS
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 353.43 357.57 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE IDEA IS THAT WE ARE GOING TO SHINE SOME LIGHT ON THE DOOR
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 357.87 367.43 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> {it's / it is / it has} GOING TO BOUNCE GO INSIDE THE ROOM SOME OF THAT IS GOING TO REFLECT BACK ON THE DOOR AND THEN BACK TO THE CAMERA AND WE ARE GOING TO EXPLOIT THESE MULTIPLE BOUNCES OF LIGHT
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 367.95 370.02 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND {it's / it is / it has} NOT SCIENCE FICTION WE HAVE ACTUALLY BUILT IT
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 370.25 372.47 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> ON THE LEFT YOU SEE OUR FEMTO CAMERA
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 372.78 377.38 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> {there's / there is / there has} A MANNEQUIN HIDDEN BEHIND A WALL AND {we are / we were} GOING TO BOUNCE LIGHT OFF THE DOOR
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 378.02 385.55 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO AFTER OUR PAPER WAS PUBLISHED IN NATURE COMMUNICATIONS IT WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY NATURE DOT COM AND THEY CREATED THIS ANIMATION
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 393.31 423.26 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> {we are / we were} GOING TO FIRE THOSE BULLETS OF LIGHT AND {they are / they were} GOING TO HIT THIS WALL AND BECAUSE THE PACKET OF THE PHOTONS THEY WILL SCATTER IN ALL THE DIRECTIONS AND SOME OF THEM WILL REACH OUR HIDDEN MANNEQUIN WHICH IN TURN WILL AGAIN SCATTER THAT LIGHT AND AGAIN IN TURN THE DOOR WILL REFLECT SOME OF THAT SCATTERED LIGHT AND A TINY FRACTION OF THE PHOTONS WILL ACTUALLY COME BACK TO THE CAMERA BUT MOST INTERESTINGLY THEY WILL ALL ARRIVE AT A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TIME SLOT
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 426.1 434.58 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND BECAUSE WE HAVE A CAMERA THAT CAN RUN SO FAST OUR FEMTO CAMERA IT HAS SOME UNIQUE ABILITIES
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 434.64 440.22 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IT HAS VERY GOOD TIME RESOLUTION AND IT CAN LOOK AT THE WORLD AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 441.42 448.88 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND THIS WAY WE KNOW THE DISTANCES OF COURSE TO THE DOOR BUT ALSO TO THE HIDDEN OBJECTS BUT WE do not KNOW WHICH POINT CORRESPONDS TO WHICH DISTANCE
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 452.13 470.19 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BY SHINING ONE LASER WE CAN RECORD ONE RAW PHOTO WHICH YOU LOOK ON THE SCREEN does not REALLY MAKE ANY SENSE BUT THEN WE WILL TAKE A LOT OF SUCH PICTURES DOZENS OF SUCH PICTURES PUT THEM TOGETHER AND TRY TO ANALYZE THE MULTIPLE BOUNCES OF LIGHT AND FROM THAT CAN WE SEE THE HIDDEN OBJECT
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 470.47 472.44 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> CAN WE SEE IT IN FULL THREE D
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 473.44 475.08 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO THIS IS OUR RECONSTRUCTION
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 488.1 514.39 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> NOW WE HAVE SOME WAYS TO GO BEFORE WE TAKE THIS OUTSIDE THE LAB ON THE ROAD BUT IN THE FUTURE WE COULD CREATE CARS THAT AVOID COLLISIONS WITH {what's / what is / what has / what does} AROUND THE BEND OR WE CAN LOOK FOR SURVIVORS IN HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS BY LOOKING AT LIGHT REFLECTED THROUGH OPEN WINDOWS OR WE CAN BUILD ENDOSCOPES THAT CAN SEE DEEP INSIDE THE BODY AROUND OCCLUDERS AND ALSO FOR CARDIOSCOPES
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 514.44 527.58 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT OF COURSE BECAUSE OF TISSUE AND BLOOD THIS IS QUITE CHALLENGING SO THIS IS REALLY A CALL FOR SCIENTISTS TO START THINKING ABOUT FEMTO PHOTOGRAPHY AS REALLY A NEW IMageing MODALITY TO SOLVE THE NEXT GENERATION OF HEALTH IMageing PROBLEMS
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 528.4 562.2 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> NOW LIKE DOC EDGERTON A SCIENTIST HIMSELF SCIENCE BECAME ART AN ART OF ULTRA FAST PHOTOGRAPHY AND I realiseD THAT ALL THE GIGABYTES OF DATA THAT {we are / we were} COLLECTING EVERY TIME IS NOT JUST FOR SCIENTIFIC IMageing BUT WE CAN ALSO DO A NEW FORM OF COMPUTATIONAL PHOTOGRAPHY WITH TIME LAPSE AND colour CODING AND WE LOOK AT THOSE RIPPLES REMEMBER THE TIME BETWEEN EACH OF THOSE RIPPLES IS ONLY A FEW TRILLIONTHS OF A SECOND
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 563.96 565.72 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT {there's / there is / there has} ALSO SOMETHING FUNNY GOING ON HERE
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 565.87 570.92 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RIPPLES UNDER THE CAP THE RIPPLES ARE MOVING AWAY FROM {us / u. s.}
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 572.2 573.9 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE RIPPLES SHOULD BE MOVING TOWARDS {us / u. s.}
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 573.94 574.78 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> {what's / what is / what has / what does} GOING ON HERE
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 575.41 587.22 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IT TURNS OUT BECAUSE {we are / we were} RECORDING NEARLY AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT WE HAVE STRANGE EFFECTS AND EINSTEIN WOULD HAVE LOVED TO SEE THIS PICTURE
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 588.43 601.58 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE ORDER AT WHICH EVENTS TAKE PLACE IN THE WORLD APPEAR IN THE CAMERA WITH some timeS REVERSED ORDER SO BY APPLYING THE CORRESPONDING SPACE AND TIME WARP WE CAN CORRECT FOR THIS DISTORTION
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 603.85 639.98 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO WHETHER {it's / it is / it has} FOR PHOTOGRAPHY AROUND CORNERS OR CREATING THE NEXT GENERATION OF HEALTH IMageing OR CREATING NEW VISUALIZATIONS SINCE OUR INVENTION WE HAVE OPEN SOURCED ALL THE DATA AND DETAILS ON OUR web site AND OUR HOPE IS THAT THE DIY THE CREATIVE AND THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY WILL SHOW {us / u. s.} THAT WE SHOULD STOP OBSESSING ABOUT THE MEGAPIXELS IN CAMERAS AND START FOCUSING ON THE NEXT DIMENSION IN IMageing
tst2013.talkid1520 1 tst2013.talkid1520 640.94 643.11 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> {it's / it is / it has} ABOUT TIME THANK YOU

tst2013.talkid1532 1 tst2013.talkid1532 128.17 129.43 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> every one WAS DOING THE SAME
tst2013.talkid1532 1 tst2013.talkid1532 129.44 134.78 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THEY WERE COLLECTING THEM UP AND HANDING THEM IN TO VARIOUS PLACES AROUND THE DIFFERENT TOWNS FOR SAFEKEEPING
tst2013.talkid1532 1 tst2013.talkid1532 135.62 143.3 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> NOW IT was not UNTIL THIS POINT THAT I realiseD THAT THESE PHOTOS WERE SUCH A HUGE PART OF THE PERSONAL LOSS THESE PEOPLE HAD FELT
tst2013.talkid1532 1 tst2013.talkid1532 143.93 150.98 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AS THEY HAD RUN FROM THE WAVE AND FOR THEIR LIVES ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING THEY HAD EVERYTHING HAD TO BE LEFT BEHIND
tst2013.talkid1532 1 tst2013.talkid1532 151.78 156.92 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AT THE END OF MY FIRST WEEK THERE I FOUND MYSELF HELPING OUT IN AN EVACUATION centre IN THE TOWN

tst2013.talkid1532 1 tst2013.talkid1532 168.38 175.27 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THIS IS WHERE PEOPLE WERE HANDING THEM IN AND I WAS honoured THAT DAY THAT THEY ACTUALLY TRUSTED ME TO HELP THEM START HAND CLEANING THEM
tst2013.talkid1532 1 tst2013.talkid1532 175.92 187.56 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> NOW IT WAS EMOTIONAL AND IT WAS INSPIRING AND i have ALWAYS HEARD ABOUT THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX BUT IT was not UNTIL I HAD ACTUALLY GOTTEN OUTSIDE OF MY BOX THAT SOMETHING HAPPENED
tst2013.talkid1532 1 tst2013.talkid1532 188.62 203.41 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AS I LOOKED THROUGH THE PHOTOS THERE WERE SOME WERE OVER A HUNDRED YEARS OLD SOME STILL IN THE ENVELOPE FROM THE PROCESSING LAB I could not HELP BUT THINK AS A RETOUCHER THAT I COULD FIX THAT TEAR AND MEND THAT SCRATCH AND I KNEW HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO COULD DO THE SAME
tst2013.talkid1532 1 tst2013.talkid1532 204.18 213.74 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO THAT EVENING I JUST REACHED OUT ON FACEBOOK AND ASKED A FEW OF THEM AND BY MORNING THE THE RESPONSE HAD BEEN SO OVERWHELMING AND SO POSITIVE I KNEW WE HAD TO GIVE IT A GO
tst2013.talkid1532 1 tst2013.talkid1532 214.0 216.98 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO WE STARTED RETOUCHING PHOTOS

tst2013.talkid1532 1 tst2013.talkid1532 230.77 237.78 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> OTHERWISE THAT LITTLE GIRL is not GOING TO LOOK LIKE THAT LITTLE GIRL any more AND SURELY {that's / that is / that has} AS TRAGIC AS HAVING THE PHOTO DAMAGED

tst2013.talkid1532 1 tst2013.talkid1532 279.82 297.51 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE OLDER LADIES some timeS had not SEEN A SCANNER BEFORE BUT WITHIN TEN MINUTES OF THEM FINDING THEIR LOST PHOTO THEY COULD GIVE IT TO {us / u. s.} HAVE IT SCANNED UPLOADED TO A CLOUD SERVER IT WOULD BE DOWNLOADED BY A GAIJIN A STRANGER SOMEWHERE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLOBE AND {it had / it would} START BEING FIXED
tst2013.talkid1532 1 tst2013.talkid1532 298.08 305.83 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE TIME IT TOOK how ever TO GET IT BACK IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STORY AND IT DEPENDED OBVIOUSLY ON THE DAMAGE INVOLVED
tst2013.talkid1532 1 tst2013.talkid1532 305.99 307.77 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IT COULD TAKE AN HOUR IT COULD TAKE WEEKS

tst2013.talkid1532 1 tst2013.talkid1532 337.31 342.76 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WE could not RETOUCH THE PHOTO UNLESS IT WAS CLEANED DRY AND RECLAIMED

tst2013.talkid1532 1 tst2013.talkid1532 496.25 502.97 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> {they are / they were} OUR MEMORY KEEPERS AND OUR HISTORIES THE LAST THING WE WOULD GRAB AND THE FIRST THING {you had / you would} GO BACK TO LOOK FOR
tst2013.talkid1532 1 tst2013.talkid1532 503.84 510.87 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> {that's / that is / that has} ALL THIS PROJECT WAS ABOUT ABOUT RESTORING THOSE LITTLE BITS OF HUMANITY GIVING SOMEONE THAT CONNECTION BACK
tst2013.talkid1532 1 tst2013.talkid1532 512.2 520.87 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WHEN A PHOTO LIKE THIS CAN BE RETURNED TO SOMEONE LIKE THIS IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF THE PERSON RECEIVING IT
tst2013.talkid1532 1 tst2013.talkid1532 522.3 525.4 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE {project's / project is / project has } ALSO MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF THE RETOUCHERS
tst2013.talkid1532 1 tst2013.talkid1532 526.43 536.08 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> FOR SOME OF THEM {it's / it is / it has} GIVEN THEM A CONNECTION TO SOMETHING BIGGER GIVING SOMETHING BACK USING THEIR TALENTS ON SOMETHING OTHER THAN SKINNY MODELS AND PERFECT SKIN
tst2013.talkid1532 1 tst2013.talkid1532 537.4 544.74 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I WOULD LIKE TO CONCLUDE BY READING AN e. mail I GOT FROM ONE OF THEM CINDY THE DAY I FINALLY GOT BACK FROM JAPAN AFTER SIX MONTHS
tst2013.talkid1532 1 tst2013.talkid1532 546.8 552.9 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AS I WORKED I could not HELP BUT THINK ABOUT THE INDIVIDUALS AND THE STORIES REPRESENTED IN THE IMAGES
tst2013.talkid1532 1 tst2013.talkid1532 552.91 569.45 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> ONE IN PARTICULAR A PHOTO OF WOMEN OF ALL AGES FROM GRANDMOTHER TO LITTLE GIRL GATHERED AROUND A BABY STRUCK A CHORD BECAUSE A SIMILAR PHOTO FROM MY FAMILY MY GRANDMOTHER MOTHER MYSELF AND NEWBORN DAUGHTER HANGS ON OUR WALL
tst2013.talkid1532 1 tst2013.talkid1532 570.55 577.00 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> ACROSS THE GLOBE THROUGHOUT THE AGES OUR BASIC NEEDS ARE JUST THE SAME are not THEY
tst2013.talkid1532 1 tst2013.talkid1532 577.10 578.10 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THANK YOU
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 16.4 23.8 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO WELL I DO APPLIED MATH AND THIS IS A PECULIAR PROBLEM FOR ANYONE WHO DOES APPLIED MATH IS THAT WE ARE LIKE MANAGEMENT CONSULTANTS
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 23.81 25.12 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> NO ONE KNOWS WHAT THE HELL WE DO
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 25.61 29.59 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME ATTEMPT TODAY TO TRY AND EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT I DO
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 30.31 33.29 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO DANCING IS ONE OF THE MOST HUMAN OF ACTIVITIES
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 33.5 38.22 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WE DELIGHT AT BALLET VIRTUOSOS AND TAP DANCERS YOU WILL SEE LATER ON
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 38.26 47.88 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> NOW BALLET REQUIRES AN EXTRAORDINARY LEVEL OF EXPERTISE AND A HIGH LEVEL OF SKILL AND PROBABLY A LEVEL OF INITIAL SUITABILITY THAT MAY WELL HAVE A GENETIC COMPONENT TO IT
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 47.89 58.79 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> NOW SADLY NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS SUCH AS PARKINSON'S DISEASE GRADUALLY DESTROY THIS EXTRAORDINARY ABILITY AS IT IS DOING TO MY FRIEND JAN STRIPLING WHO WAS A VIRTUOSO BALLET DANCER IN HIS TIME
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 59.4 62.09 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO GREAT PROGRESS IN TREATMENT HAS BEEN MADE OVER THE YEARS
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 62.1 78.4 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> how ever THERE ARE SIX POINT THREE MILLION PEOPLE world wide WHO HAVE THE DISEASE AND THEY HAVE TO LIVE WITH INCURABLE WEAKNESS TREMOR RIGIDITY AND THE OTHER SYMPTOMS THAT GO ALONG WITH THE DISEASE SO WHAT WE NEED ARE OBJECTIVE TOOLS TO DETECT THE DISEASE BEFORE {it's / it is / it has} TOO LATE
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 78.44 89.12 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MEASURE PROGRESSION OBJECTIVELY AND ULTIMATELY THE ONLY WAY {we are / we were} GOING TO KNOW WHEN WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CURE IS WHEN WE HAVE AN OBJECTIVE MEASURE THAT CAN ANSWER THAT FOR SURE
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 90.31 100.93 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT FRUSTRATINGLY WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE AND OTHER MOVEMENT DISORDERS THERE ARE NO BIOMARKERS SO {there's / there is / there has} NO SIMPLE BLOOD TEST THAT YOU CAN DO AND THE BEST THAT WE HAVE IS LIKE THIS TWENTY MINUTE NEUROLOGIST TEST
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 101.2 108.67 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE CLINIC TO DO IT {it's / it is / it has} VERY VERY COSTLY AND THAT MEANS THAT OUTSIDE THE CLINICAL TRIALS {it's / it is / it has} JUST NEVER DONE {it's / it is / it has} NEVER DONE
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 109.38 111.38 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT WHAT IF PATIENTS COULD DO THIS TEST AT HOME
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 112.26 118.44 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> NOW THAT WOULD ACTUALLY SAVE ON A DIFFICULT TRIP TO THE CLINIC AND WHAT IF PATIENTS COULD DO THAT TEST THEMSELVES RIGHT
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 118.53 120.08 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> NO EXPENSIVE STAFF TIME REQUIRED
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 120.45 123.07 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> TAKES ABOUT THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS BY THE WAY IN THE NEUROLOGIST'S CLINIC TO DO IT
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 123.95 132.62 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO WHAT I WANT TO PROPOSE TO YOU AS AN UNCONVENTIONAL WAY IN WHICH WE CAN TRY TO ACHIEVE THIS BECAUSE YOU SEE IN ONE SENSE AT LEAST WE ARE ALL VIRTUOSOS LIKE MY FRIEND JAN STRIPLING
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 133.34 137.0 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO HERE WE HAVE A VIDEO OF THE VIBRATING VOCAL FOLDS
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 137.7 150.18 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> NOW THIS IS HEALTHY AND THIS IS SOMEBODY MAKING SPEECH SOUNDS AND WE CAN THINK OF OURSELVES AS VOCAL BALLET DANCERS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO COORDINATE ALL OF THESE VOCAL ORGANS WHEN WE MAKE SOUNDS AND WE ALL ACTUALLY HAVE THE GENES FOR IT FOX P TWO FOR EXAMPLE
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 150.55 153.09 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND LIKE BALLET IT TAKES AN EXTRAORDINARY LEVEL OF TRAINING
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 153.1 155.36 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I MEAN JUST THINK HOW LONG IT TAKES A CHILD TO LEARN TO SPEAK
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 155.9 165.28 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> FROM THE SOUND WE CAN ACTUALLY TRACK THE VOCAL FOLD POSITION AS IT VIBRATES AND JUST AS THE LIMBS ARE AFFECTED IN PARKINSON'S SO TOO ARE THE VOCAL ORGANS
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 165.62 168.86 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO ON THE BOTTOM TRACE YOU CAN SEE AN EXAMPLE OF IRREGULAR VOCAL FOLD TREMOR
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 169.4 170.61 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WE SEE ALL THE SAME SYMPTOMS
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 170.62 173.14 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WE SEE VOCAL TREMOR WEAKNESS AND RIGIDITY
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 173.47 177.56 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE SPEECH ACTUALLY BECOMES QUIETER AND MORE BREATHY AFTER A WHILE AND {that's / that is / that has} ONE OF THE EXAMPLE SYMPTOMS OF IT
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 178.02 198.28 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO THESE VOCAL EFFECTS CAN ACTUALLY BE QUITE SUBTLE IN SOME CASES BUT WITH ANY DIGITAL MICROPHONE AND USING PRECISION VOICE ANALYSIS SOFTWARE IN COMBINATION WITH THE LATEST IN MACHINE LEARNING WHICH IS VERY ADVANCED BY NOW WE CAN NOW QUANTIFY EXACTLY WHERE SOMEBODY LIES ON A CONTINUUM BETWEEN HEALTH AND DISEASE USING VOICE SIGNALS ALONE
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 198.54 203.35 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO THESE VOICE BASED TESTS HOW DO THEY STACK UP AGAINST EXPERT CLINICAL TESTS WELL {they are / they were} BOTH NON INVASIVE
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 204.15 207.28 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE NEUROLOGIST'S TEST IS NON INVASIVE THEY BOTH USE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 207.48 210.15 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> YOU do not HAVE TO DESIGN A WHOLE NEW SET OF HOSPITALS TO DO IT
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 210.77 215.63 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND {they are / they were} BOTH ACCURATE o. k. BUT IN ADDITION VOICE BASED TESTS ARE NON EXPERT
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 215.8 217.75 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THAT MEANS THEY CAN BE SELF ADMINISTERED
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 217.79 220.15 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> {they are / they were} HIGH SPEED TAKE ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS AT MOST
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 220.5 222.28 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> {they are / they were} ULTRA LOW COST AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 222.56 226.64 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WHEN SOMETHING BECOMES ULTRA LOW COST IT BECOMES MASSIVELY SCALABLE
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 227.38 231.01 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND SO HERE ARE SOME AMAZING GOALS THAT I THINK WE CAN DEAL WITH NOW
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 231.07 233.65 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WE CAN REDUCE LOGISTICAL DIFFICULTIES WITH PATIENTS
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 233.66 235.79 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> NO NEED TO GO TO THE CLINIC FOR A ROUTINE CHECKUP
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 235.8 238.4 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WE CAN DO HIGH FREQUENCY MONITORING TO GET OBJECTIVE DATA
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 238.65 245.77 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WE CAN PERFORM LOW COST MASS RECRUITMENT FOR CLINICAL TRIALS AND WE CAN MAKE POPULATION SCALE SCREENING FEASIBLE FOR THE FIRST TIME
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 245.81 251.35 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO START TO SEARCH FOR THE EARLY BIOMARKERS OF THE DISEASE BEFORE {it's / it is / it has} TOO LATE
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 252.0 256.37 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO TAKING THE FIRST STEPS TOWARDS THIS TODAY {we are / we were} LAUNCHING THE PARKINSON'S VOICE INITIATIVE
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 256.54 263.64 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WITH ACULAB AND PATIENTS LIKE ME {we are / we were} AIMING TO RECORD A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF VOICES world wide TO COLLECT ENOUGH DATA TO START TO TACKLE THESE FOUR GOALS
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 263.72 266.94 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WE HAVE LOCAL NUMBERS ACCESSIBLE TO THREE QUARTERS OF A BILLION PEOPLE ON THE PLANET
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 267.1 277.88 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> ANYONE HEALTHY OR WITH PARKINSON'S CAN CALL IN CHEAPLY AND LEAVE RECORDINGS A FEW CENTS EACH AND i am REALLY HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE THAT we have ALREADY HIT SIX per cent OF OUR TARGET JUST IN EIGHT HOURS
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 278.08 278.55 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THANK YOU
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 288.35 297.23 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO MAX BY TAKING ALL THESE SAMPLES OF let us SAY TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE you will BE ABLE TO TELL {who's / who is / who has} HEALTHY AND {who's / who is / who has} NOT
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 297.27 299.09 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO GET OUT OF THOSE SAMPLES
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 299.1 304.23 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> YEAH YEAH SO WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS THAT DURING THE CALL YOU HAVE TO INDICATE WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE THE DISEASE OR NOT YOU SEE RIGHT
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 304.27 306.41 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> YOU SEE SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT DO IT THEY MAY NOT GET THROUGH IT
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 306.42 319.93 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT we will GET A VERY LARGE SAMPLE OF DATA THAT IS COLLECTED FROM ALL DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND {it's / it is / it has} GETTING IT IN DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MATTER BECAUSE THEN WE ARE LOOKING AT IRONING OUT THE CONFOUNDING FACTORS AND LOOKING FOR THE ACTUAL MARKERS OF THE DISEASE
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 319.99 322.46 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO {you are / you were} EIGHTY SIX per cent ACCURATE RIGHT NOW
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 322.5 323.58 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> {it's / it is / it has} MUCH BETTER THAN THAT
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 323.59 334.29 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> ACTUALLY MY STUDENT THANASIS I HAVE TO PLUG HIM BECAUSE { he's / he was / he is / he has} DONE SOME FANTASTIC WORK AND NOW HE HAS PROVED THAT IT WORKS OVER THE MOBILE TELEPHONE NETWORK AS WELL WHICH ENABLES THIS PROJECT AND {we are / we were} GETTING NINETY NINE per cent ACCURACY
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 334.33 335.78 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> NINETY NINE WELL {that's / that is / that has} AN IMPROVEMENT
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 336.29 350.09 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO CALL IN FROM THEIR MOBILE PHONES AND DO THIS TEST AND PEOPLE WITH PARKINSON'S COULD CALL IN RECORD THEIR VOICE AND THEN THEIR DOCTOR CAN CHECK UP ON THEIR PROGRESS SEE WHERE {they are / they were} DOING IN THIS COURSE OF THE DISEASE
tst2013.talkid1534 1 tst2013.talkid1534 350.4 351.50 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> ABSOLUTELY

tst2013.talkid1539 1 tst2013.talkid1539 36.89 38.79 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME IN AFGHANISTAN
tst2013.talkid1539 1 tst2013.talkid1539 40.7 58.51 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> LONG BEFORE THAT I HAD GROWN UP WITH THE WAR BUT along side WEEKEND SLEEPOVERS AND SATURDAY SOCCER GAMES AND FISTFIGHTS WITH RACIST CHILDREN OF THE CONFEDERACY AND RELIGIO NATIONALIST DEMONSTRATIONS CHANTING DOWN WITH COMMUNISM AND LONG LIVE AFGHANISTAN AND BURNING EFFIGIES OF BREZHNEV BEFORE I EVEN KNEW WHAT IT MEANT
tst2013.talkid1539 1 tst2013.talkid1539 60.16 62.1 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT THIS IS THE GEOGRAPHY OF SELF
tst2013.talkid1539 1 tst2013.talkid1539 63.6 76.86 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND SO I STAND HERE TODAY AFGHAN BY BLOOD REDNECK BY THE GRACE OF GOD AN ATHEIST AND A RADICALLY POLITICIZED ARTIST {who's / who is / who has} BEEN LIVING WORKING AND CREATING IN AFGHANISTAN FOR THE LAST NINE YEARS
tst2013.talkid1539 1 tst2013.talkid1539 78.08 99.72 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> NOW THERE ARE A LOT OF WONDERFUL THINGS THAT YOU COULD MAKE ART ABOUT IN AFGHANISTAN BUT PERSONALLY I do not WANT TO PAINT RAINBOWS I WANT TO MAKE ART THAT DISTURBS IDENTITY AND CHALLENGES AUTHORITY AND EXPOSES HYPOCRISY AND REINTERPRETS REALITY AND EVEN USES KIND OF AN IMAGINATIVE ETHNOGRAPHY TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND THE WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN

tst2013.talkid1539 1 tst2013.talkid1539 179.63 185.2 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I WANT TO LOOK AT HOW IN MY OPINION THE CONFLICT IN AFGHANISTAN HAS BECOME CONFLICT CHIC
tst2013.talkid1539 1 tst2013.talkid1539 185.21 208.28 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE WAR AND THE EXPATRIATE LIFE THAT COMES WITH IT HAVE CREATED THIS ENVIRONMENT OF STYLE AND FASHION THAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED THROUGH CREATING A FASHION LINE FOR SOLDIERS AND SUICIDE BOMBERS WHERE I TAKE LOCAL AFGHAN FOX FUR AND ADD IT TO A FLACK JACKET OR MAKE MULTIPLE INTERIOR POCKETS ON FASHIONABLE NEO TRADITIONAL VESTS
tst2013.talkid1539 1 tst2013.talkid1539 210.43 234.54 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND {i had / i would} LIKE TO LOOK AT HOW TAKING A SIMPLE KABUL WHEELBARROW AND PUTTING IT ON THE WALL AMIDST KIPLING'S CALL OF EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE TO GENERATE DIALOGUE ABOUT HOW I SEE CONTEMPORARY DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES BEING ROOTED IN {yesterday's / yesterday is / yesterday has} COLONIAL RHETORIC ABOUT A WHITE {man's / man is / man has} BURDEN TO SAVE THE BROWN MAN FROM HIMSELF AND MAYBE EVEN civilisE HIM A BIT
tst2013.talkid1539 1 tst2013.talkid1539 237.17 243.62 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT DOING THESE THINGS THEY CAN GET YOU IN JAIL THEY CAN BE MISUNDERSTOOD MISINTERPRETED
tst2013.talkid1539 1 tst2013.talkid1539 244.85 248.81 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT I DO THEM BECAUSE I HAVE TO BECAUSE THE GEOGRAPHY OF SELF MANDATES IT

tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 15.99 20.94 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> ONE OF MY favourITE WORDS IN THE WHOLE OF THE OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY IS SNOLLYGOSTER
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 21.42 22.69 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> JUST BECAUSE IT SOUNDS SO GOOD
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 22.94 26.17 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND WHAT SNOLLYGOSTER MEANS IS A DISHONEST POLITICIAN
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 27.38 45.13 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A NINETEENTH CENTURY news paper EDITOR WHO DEFINED IT RATHER BETTER WHEN HE SAID A SNOLLYGOSTER IS A FELLOW WHO SEEKS OFFICE REGARDLESS OF PARTY PLATFORM OR PRINCIPLE AND WHO WHEN HE WINS GETS THERE BY THE SHEER FORCE OF MONUMENTAL TALKNOPHICAL ASSUMNANCY
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 45.54 48.26 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> NOW I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TALKNOPHICAL IS
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 48.51 49.84 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SOMETHING TO DO WITH WORDS I ASSUME
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 49.85 56.67 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT {it's / it is / it has} VERY IMPORTANT THAT WORDS ARE AT THE centre OF POLITICS AND ALL POLITICIANS KNOW THEY HAVE TO TRY AND CONTROL LANGUAGE
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 56.88 67.34 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IT was not UNTIL FOR EXAMPLE SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE THAT THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT ALLOWED NEWSPAPERS TO REPORT THE EXACT WORDS THAT WERE SAID IN THE DEBATING CHAMBER
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 67.63 75.16 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND THIS WAS ACTUALLY ALL DOWN TO THE BRAVERY OF A GUY WITH THE EXTRAORDINARY NAME OF BRASS CROSBY WHO TOOK ON PARLIAMENT
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 75.2 86.46 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND HE WAS THROWN INTO THE TOWER OF LONDON AND IMPRISONED AND BUT HE WAS BRAVE ENOUGH HE WAS BRAVE ENOUGH TO TAKE THEM ON AND IN THE END HE HAD SUCH POPULAR SUPPORT IN LONDON THAT HE WON
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 87.13 93.53 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND IT WAS ONLY A FEW YEARS LATER THAT WE HAVE THE FIRST RECORDED USE OF THE PHRASE AS BOLD AS BRASS
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 94.32 96.2 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> MOST PEOPLE THINK {that's / that is / that has} DOWN TO THE METAL
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 96.21 99.88 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> {it's / it is / it has} NOT {it's / it is / it has} DOWN TO A CAMPAIGNER FOR THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 100.87 109.94 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT TO REALLY SHOW YOU HOW WORDS AND POLITICS INTERACT I WANT TO TAKE YOU BACK TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA JUST AFTER {they had / they would} ACHIEVED INDEPENDENCE
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 110.48 114.93 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND THEY HAD TO FACE THE QUESTION OF WHAT TO CALL GEORGE WASHINGTON THEIR LEADER
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 114.94 115.66 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THEY did not KNOW
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 116.24 119.02 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WHAT DO YOU CALL THE LEADER OF A REPUBLICAN COUNTRY
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 119.61 122.48 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND THIS WAS DEBATED IN CONGRESS FOR AGES AND AGES
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 122.49 125.97 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND THERE WERE ALL SORTS OF SUGGESTIONS ON THE TABLE WHICH MIGHT HAVE MADE IT
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 126.2 139.89 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I MEAN SOME PEOPLE WANTED HIM TO BE CALLED CHIEF MAGISTRATE WASHINGTON AND OTHER PEOPLE HIS HIGHNESS GEORGE WASHINGTON AND OTHER PEOPLE PROTECTOR OF THE PROTECTOR OF THE LIBERTIES OF THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WASHINGTON
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 139.94 140.91 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> NOT THAT CATCHY
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 141.59 143.91 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SOME PEOPLE JUST WANTED TO CALL HIM KING
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 144.12 145.47 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THEY THOUGHT IT WAS TRIED AND TESTED
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 145.48 150.19 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND THEY were not EVEN BEING MONARCHICAL THERE THEY HAD THE IDEA THAT YOU COULD BE ELECTED KING FOR A FIXED TERM
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 150.54 151.78 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND YOU KNOW IT COULD HAVE WORKED
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 152.06 156.51 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND EVERYBODY GOT INSANELY BORED ACTUALLY BECAUSE THIS DEBATE WENT ON FOR THREE WEEKS
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 156.52 160.81 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I READ A DIARY OF THIS POOR SENATOR WHO JUST KEEPS COMING BACK STILL ON THIS SUBJECT
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 161.08 166.99 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND THE REASON FOR THE DELAY AND THE BOREDOM WAS THAT THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WERE AGAINST THE SENATE
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 167.17 171.29 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES did not WANT WASHINGTON TO GET DRUNK ON POWER
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 171.61 175.57 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THEY did not WANT TO CALL HIM KING IN CASE THAT GAVE HIM IDEAS OR HIS SUCCESSOR IDEAS
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 176.01 181.61 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO THEY WANTED TO GIVE HIM THE HUMBLEST MEAGEREST MOST PATHETIC TITLE THAT THEY COULD THINK OF
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 182.64 185.71 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND THAT TITLE WAS PRESIDENT
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 188.22 194.0 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> PRESIDENT THEY did not INVENT THE TITLE I MEAN IT EXISTED BEFORE BUT IT JUST MEANT SOMEBODY WHO PRESIDES OVER A MEETING
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 194.29 196.3 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IT WAS LIKE THE THE FOREMAN OF THE JURY
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 196.31 199.94 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND IT did not HAVE MUCH MORE GRANDEUR THAN THE TERM FOREMAN OR OVERSEER
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 199.95 205.71 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THERE WERE OCCASIONAL PRESIDENTS OF LITTLE COLONIAL COUNCILS AND BITS OF GOVERNMENT BUT IT WAS REALLY A NOTHING TITLE
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 206.26 208.12 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND {that's / that is / that has} WHY THE SENATE OBJECTED TO IT
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 208.28 211.34 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THEY SAID {that's / that is / that has} RIDICULOUS YOU {can not / cannot} CALL HIM PRESIDENT
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 211.97 215.23 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THIS GUY HAS TO GO AND SIGN TREATIES AND MEET FOREIGN DIGNITARIES
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 215.45 221.89 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND {who's / who is / who has} GOING TO TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY IF { he's / he was / he is / he has} GOT A SILLY LITTLE TITLE LIKE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 222.64 229.17 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND AFTER THREE WEEKS OF DEBATE IN THE END THE SENATE DID NOT CAVE IN
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 230.63 273.68 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> INSTEAD THEY AGREED TO USE THE TITLE PRESIDENT FOR NOW BUT THEY ALSO WANTED IT ABSOLUTELY SET DOWN THAT THEY did not AGREE WITH IT FROM A A DECENT RESPECT FOR THE OPINIONS AND PRACTICE OF civilisED NATIONS WHETHER UNDER REPUBLICAN OR MONARCHICAL FORMS OF GOVERNMENT WHOSE CUSTOM IT IS TO ANNEX THROUGH THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE TITLES OF RESPECTABILITY NOT BLOODY PRESIDENT AND THAT IN THE INTERCOURSE WITH FOREIGN NATIONS THE MAJESTY OF THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES MAY NOT BE HAZARDED BY AN APPEARANCE OF SINGULARITY IE WE do not WANT TO LOOK LIKE BLOODY WEIRDOS
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 275.74 277.53 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> NOW YOU CAN LEARN THREE INTERESTING THINGS FROM THIS
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 278.05 287.28 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> FIRST OF ALL AND THIS IS MY favourITE IS THAT SO FAR AS i have EVER BEEN ABLE TO FIND OUT THE SENATE HAS NEVER FORMALLY ENDORSED THE TITLE OF PRESIDENT
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 288.34 294.13 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BARACK OBAMA PRESIDENT OBAMA IS THERE ON BORROWED TIME JUST WAITING FOR THE SENATE TO SPRING INTO ACTION
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 295.71 307.15 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SECOND THING YOU CAN LEARN IS THAT WHEN A GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT THIS IS A TEMPORARY MEASURE YOU CAN STILL BE WAITING TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE YEARS LATER
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 308.04 320.69 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT THE THIRD THING YOU CAN LEARN AND THIS IS THE REALLY IMPORTANT ONE THIS IS THE POINT I WANT TO LEAVE YOU ON IS THAT THE TITLE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA does not SOUND THAT HUMBLE AT ALL THESE DAYS DOES IT
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 321.55 331.34 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE SLIGHTLY OVER FIVE THOUSAND NUCLEAR WARHEADS HE HAS AT HIS DISPOSAL AND THE LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND A FLEET OF DRONES AND ALL THAT SORT OF STUFF
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 332.79 338.61 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> REALITY AND HISTORY HAVE ENDOWED THAT TITLE WITH GRANDEUR
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 339.76 341.3 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND SO THE SENATE WON IN THE END
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 341.35 343.03 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THEY GOT THEIR TITLE OF RESPECTABILITY
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 343.86 349.03 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND ALSO THE {senate's / senate is / senate has} OTHER WORRY THE APPEARANCE OF SINGULARITY WELL IT WAS A SINGULARITY BACK THEN
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 349.55 351.95 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT NOW DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY NATIONS HAVE A PRESIDENT
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 352.44 353.92 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 354.78 359.05 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> ALL BECAUSE THEY WANT TO SOUND LIKE THE GUY {who's / who is / who has} GOT THE FIVE THOUSAND NUCLEAR WARHEADS ETC
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 361.43 374.79 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND SO IN THE END THE SENATE WON AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES LOST BECAUSE {nobody's / nobody is / nobody has} GOING TO FEEL THAT HUMBLE WHEN {they are / they were} TOLD THAT THEY ARE NOW THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 376.47 379.8 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND {that's / that is / that has} THE IMPORTANT LESSON I THINK YOU CAN TAKE AWAY AND THE ONE I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH
tst2013.talkid1548 1 tst2013.talkid1548 380.05 391.64 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> POLITICIANS TRY TO PICK WORDS AND USE WORDS TO SHAPE REALITY AND CONTROL REALITY BUT IN FACT REALITY CHANGES WORDS FAR MORE THAN WORDS CAN EVER CHANGE REALITY

tst2013.talkid1553 1 tst2013.talkid1553 339.48 341.94 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THINKING ABOUT DEATH CLARIFIES YOUR LIFE
tst2013.talkid1553 1 tst2013.talkid1553 345.01 360.74 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> OUR SHARED SPACES CAN BETTER REFLECT WHAT MATTERS TO {us / u. s.} AS INDIVIDUALS AND AS A COMMUNITY AND WITH MORE WAYS TO SHARE OUR HOPES FEARS AND STORIES THE PEOPLE AROUND {us / u. s.} CAN NOT ONLY HELP {us / u. s.} MAKE BETTER PLACES THEY CAN HELP {us / u. s.} LEAD BETTER LIVES
tst2013.talkid1553 1 tst2013.talkid1553 360.79 361.55 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THANK YOU
tst2013.talkid1553 1 tst2013.talkid1553 361.59 362.11 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THANK YOU
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 16.68 21.99 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> FIVE YEARS AGO I EXPERIENCED A BIT OF WHAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE TO BE ALICE IN WONDERLAND
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 22.4 28.21 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> PENN STATE ASKED ME A COMMUNICATIONS TEACHER TO TEACH A COMMUNICATIONS CLASS FOR ENGINEERING STUDENTS
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 29.2 30.54 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND I WAS SCARED
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 31.52 38.28 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> REALLY SCARED SCARED OF THESE STUDENTS WITH THEIR BIG BRAINS AND THEIR BIG BOOKS AND THEIR BIG UNFAMILIAR WORDS
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 38.55 48.17 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT AS THESE CONVERSATIONS UNFOLDED I EXPERIENCED WHAT ALICE MUST HAVE WHEN SHE WENT DOWN THAT RABBIT HOLE AND SAW THAT DOOR TO A WHOLE NEW WORLD
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 48.84 59.09 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> {that's / that is / that has} JUST HOW I FELT AS I HAD THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE STUDENTS I WAS AMAZED AT THE IDEAS THAT THEY THAT THEY HAD AND I WANTED OTHERS TO EXPERIENCE THIS WONDERLAND AS WELL
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 59.15 62.89 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND I BELIEVE THE KEY TO OPENING THAT DOOR IS GREAT COMMUNICATION
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 63.13 69.09 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WE DESPERATELY NEED GREAT COMMUNICATION FROM OUR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS IN ORDER TO CHANGE THE WORLD
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 69.24 86.93 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> OUR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE TACKLING OUR GRANDEST CHALLENGES FROM ENERGY TO ENVIRONMENT TO HEALTH CARE AMONG OTHERS AND IF WE do not KNOW ABOUT IT AND UNDERSTAND IT THEN THE WORK is not DONE AND I BELIEVE {it's / it is / it has} OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS NON SCIENTISTS TO HAVE THESE INTERACTIONS
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 87.21 93.17 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT THESE GREAT CONVERSATIONS {can not / cannot} OCCUR IF OUR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS do not INVITE {us / u. s.} IN TO SEE THEIR WONDERLAND
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 93.33 98.11 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS PLEASE TALK NERDY TO {us / u. s.}
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 99.1 108.03 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I WANT TO SHARE A FEW KEYS ON HOW YOU CAN DO THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN SEE THAT YOUR SCIENCE IS SEXY AND THAT YOUR ENGINEERING IS ENGageing
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 108.35 111.61 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> FIRST QUESTION TO ANSWER FOR {us / u. s.} SO WHAT
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 111.92 115.6 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> TELL {us / u. s.} WHY YOUR SCIENCE IS RELEVANT TO {us / u. s.}
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 115.86 126.67 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> do not JUST TELL ME THAT YOU STUDY TRABECULAE BUT TELL ME THAT YOU STUDY TRABECULAE WHICH IS THE MESH LIKE STRUCTURE OF OUR BONES BECAUSE {it's / it is / it has} IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING AND TREATING OSTEOPOROSIS
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 127.64 131.46 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND WHEN {you are / you were} DESCRIBING YOUR SCIENCE BEWARE OF JARGON
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 131.63 135.06 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> JARGON IS A BARRIER TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR IDEAS
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 135.26 141.59 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SURE YOU CAN SAY SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL BUT WHY NOT JUST SAY SPACE AND TIME WHICH IS SO MUCH MORE ACCESSIBLE TO {us / u. s.}
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 142.01 146.6 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND MAKING YOUR IDEAS ACCESSIBLE IS NOT THE SAME AS DUMBING IT DOWN
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 146.86 152.9 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> INSTEAD AS EINSTEIN SAID MAKE EVERYTHING AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE BUT NO SIMPLER
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 153.14 158.36 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> YOU CAN CLEARLY COMMUNICATE YOUR SCIENCE with out COMPROMISING THE IDEAS
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 158.84 166.13 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> A FEW THINGS TO CONSIDER ARE HAVING EXAMPLES STORIES AND ANALOGIES THOSE ARE WAYS TO ENGAGE AND EXCITE {us / u. s.} ABOUT YOUR CONTENT
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 166.7 172.48 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND WHEN PRESENTING YOUR WORK DROP THE BULLET POINTS
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 172.76 175.65 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHY {they are / they were} CALLED BULLET POINTS
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 176.74 180.86 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WHAT DO BULLETS DO BULLETS KILL AND THEY WILL KILL YOUR PRESENTATION
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 181.46 189.14 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> A SLIDE LIKE THIS IS NOT ONLY BORING BUT IT RELIES TOO MUCH ON THE LANGUAGE AREA OF OUR BRAIN AND CAUSES {us / u. s.} TO BECOME OVERWHELMED
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 189.44 202.06 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> INSTEAD THIS EXAMPLE SLIDE BY GENEVIEVE BROWN IS MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE {it's / it is / it has} SHOWING THAT THE SPECIAL STRUCTURE OF TRABECULAE ARE SO STRONG THAT THEY ACTUALLY INSPIRED THE UNIQUE DESIGN OF THE EIFFEL TOWER
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 202.37 216.4 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND THE TRICK HERE IS TO USE A SINGLE READABLE SENTENCE THAT THE AUDIENCE CAN KEY INTO IF THEY GET A BIT LOST AND THEN PROVIDE VISUALS WHICH APPEAL TO OUR OTHER SENSES AND CREATE A DEEPER SENSE OF UNDERSTANDING OF {what's / what is / what has / what does} BEING DESCRIBED
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 216.78 224.98 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO I THINK THESE ARE JUST A FEW KEYS THAT CAN HELP THE REST OF {us / u. s.} TO OPEN THAT DOOR AND SEE THE WONDERLAND THAT IS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 225.13 233.58 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND BECAUSE THE ENGINEERS THAT i have WORKED WITH HAVE TAUGHT ME TO BECOME REALLY IN TOUCH WITH MY INNER NERD I WANT TO SUMMARIZE WITH AN EQUATION
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 234.57 254.18 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> TAKE YOUR SCIENCE SUBTRACT YOUR BULLET POINTS AND YOUR JARGON DIVIDE BY RELEVANCE MEANING SHARE {what's / what is / what has / what does} RELEVANT TO THE AUDIENCE AND MULTIPLY IT BY THE PASSION THAT YOU HAVE FOR THIS INCREDIBLE WORK THAT {you are / you were} DOING AND THAT IS GOING TO EQUAL INCREDIBLE INTERACTIONS THAT ARE FULL OF UNDERSTANDING
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 254.28 261.57 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND SO SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS WHEN you have SOLVED THIS EQUATION BY ALL MEANS TALK NERDY TO ME
tst2013.talkid1592 1 tst2013.talkid1592 262.19 262.57 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THANK YOU

tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 27.23 31.33 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> REMI IS TWENTY TWO TALL AND VERY HANDSOME
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 32.96 39.15 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> { he's / he was / he is / he has} SPEECHLESS BUT HE COMMUNICATES JOY IN A WAY THAT SOME OF THE BEST ORATORS can not
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 40.38 42.5 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> REMI KNOWS WHAT LOVE IS
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 43.11 46.47 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> HE SHARES IT UNCONDITIONALLY AND HE SHARES IT REGARDLESS
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 47.45 50.86 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> { he's / he was / he is / he has} NOT GREEDY HE does not SEE SKIN colour
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 50.87 56.33 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> HE does not CARE ABOUT RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES AND GET THIS HE HAS NEVER TOLD A LIE
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 57.64 69.07 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WHEN HE SINGS SONGS FROM OUR CHILDHOOD ATTEMPTING WORDS THAT NOT EVEN I COULD REMEMBER HE REMINDS ME OF ONE THING HOW LITTLE WE KNOW ABOUT THE MIND AND HOW WONDERFUL THE UNKNOWN MUST BE
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 71.56 76.2 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SAMUEL IS SIXTEEN { he's / he was / he is / he has} TALL { he's / he was / he is / he has} VERY HANDSOME
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 77.51 79.82 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> HE HAS THE MOST IMPECCABLE MEMORY
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 80.88 83.48 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> HE HAS A SELECTIVE ONE THOUGH
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 83.49 98.0 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> HE does not REMEMBER IF HE STOLE MY CHOCOLATE BAR BUT HE REMEMBERS THE YEAR OF RELEASE FOR EVERY SONG ON MY IPOD CONVERSATIONS WE HAD WHEN HE WAS FOUR WEEING ON MY ARM ON THE FIRST EVER EPISODE OF TELETUBBIES AND LADY GAGA'S BIRTHDAY
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 99.67 101.18 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> do not THEY SOUND INCREDIBLE
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 102.35 104.57 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT MOST PEOPLE do not AGREE
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 105.38 112.89 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND IN FACT BECAUSE THEIR MINDS do not FIT INTO {society's / society is / society has} VERSION OF NORMAL {they are / they were} OFTEN BYPASSED AND MISUNDERSTOOD
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 113.87 131.95 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT WHAT LIFTED MY HEART AND STRENGTHENED MY SOUL WAS THAT EVEN THOUGH THIS WAS THE CASE ALTHOUGH THEY WERE NOT SEEN AS ORDINARY THIS COULD ONLY MEAN ONE THING THAT THEY WERE EXTRAORDINARY AUTISTIC AND EXTRAORDINARY
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 132.94 144.7 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> NOW FOR YOU WHO MAY BE LESS FAMILIAR WITH THE TERM AUTISM {it's / it is / it has} A COMPLEX BRAIN DISORDER THAT AFFECTS SOCIAL COMMUNICATION LEARNING AND some timeS PHYSICAL SKILLS
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 145.13 149.78 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IT MANIFESTS IN EACH INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENTLY HENCE WHY REMI IS SO DIFFERENT FROM SAM
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 150.41 161.36 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND ACROSS THE WORLD EVERY TWENTY MINUTES ONE NEW PERSON IS DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM AND ALTHOUGH {it's / it is / it has} ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS IN THE WORLD THERE IS NO KNOWN CAUSE OR CURE
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 162.31 168.28 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND I can not REMEMBER THE FIRST MOMENT I ENCOUNTERED AUTISM BUT I can not RECALL A DAY with out IT
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 168.52 176.2 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I WAS JUST THREE YEARS OLD WHEN MY BROTHER CAME ALONG AND I WAS SO EXCITED THAT I HAD A NEW BEING IN MY LIFE
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 176.41 180.79 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND AFTER A FEW MONTHS WENT BY I realiseD THAT HE WAS DIFFERENT
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 181.23 183.02 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> HE SCREAMED A LOT
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 183.65 190.67 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> HE did not WANT TO PLAY LIKE THE OTHER BABIES DID AND IN FACT HE did not SEEM VERY INTERESTED IN ME WHATSOEVER
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 191.66 204.29 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> REMI LIVED AND REIGNED IN HIS OWN WORLD WITH HIS OWN RULES AND HE FOUND PLEASURE IN THE SMALLEST THINGS LIKE LINING UP CARS AROUND THE ROOM AND STARING AT THE WASHING MACHINE AND EATING ANYTHING THAT CAME IN BETWEEN
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 206.07 211.07 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND AS HE GREW OLDER HE GREW MORE DIFFERENT AND THE DIFFERENCES BECAME MORE OBVIOUS
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 211.96 229.52 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> YET BEYOND THE TANTRUMS AND THE FRUSTRATION AND THE NEVER ENDING HYPERACTIVITY WAS SOMETHING REALLY UNIQUE A PURE AND INNOCENT NATURE A BOY WHO SAW THE WORLD with out PREJUDICE A HUMAN WHO HAD NEVER LIED
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 230.62 231.85 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> EXTRAORDINARY
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 233.29 240.53 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> NOW I can not DENY THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CHALLENGING MOMENTS IN MY FAMILY MOMENTS WHERE i have WISHED THAT THEY WERE JUST LIKE ME
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 241.0 253.74 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT I CAST MY MIND BACK TO THE THINGS THAT they have TAUGHT ME ABOUT INDIVIDUALITY AND COMMUNICATION AND LOVE AND I realise THAT THESE ARE THINGS THAT I would not WANT TO CHANGE WITH NORMALITY
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 255.46 263.55 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> NORMALITY OVERLOOKS THE BEAUTY THAT DIFFERENCES GIVE {us / u. s.} AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE DIFFERENT does not MEAN THAT ONE OF {us / u. s.} IS WRONG
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 263.86 266.19 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IT JUST MEANS THAT {there's / there is / there has} A DIFFERENT KIND OF RIGHT
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 267.61 277.79 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND IF I COULD COMMUNICATE JUST ONE THING TO REMI AND TO SAM AND TO YOU IT WOULD BE THAT YOU do not HAVE TO BE NORMAL
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 279.36 281.63 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> YOU CAN BE EXTRAORDINARY
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 283.35 297.36 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BECAUSE AUTISTIC OR NOT THE DIFFERENCES THAT WE HAVE we have GOT A GIFT every one'S GOT A GIFT INSIDE OF {us / u. s.} AND IN ALL HONESTY THE PURSUIT OF NORMALITY IS THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE OF POTENTIAL
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 298.49 305.87 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE CHANCE FOR GREATNESS FOR PROGRESS AND FOR CHANGE DIES THE MOMENT WE TRY TO BE LIKE SOMEONE ELSE
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 307.05 309.41 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> PLEASE do not TELL ME i am NORMAL
tst2013.talkid1600 1 tst2013.talkid1600 310.02 310.39 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THANK YOU
tst2013.talkid1610 1 tst2013.talkid1610 15.87 19.43 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT A VERY SPECIAL GROUP OF ANIMALS
tst2013.talkid1610 1 tst2013.talkid1610 20.13 23.84 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THERE ARE TEN THOUSAND SPECIES OF BIRDS IN THE WORLD
tst2013.talkid1610 1 tst2013.talkid1610 24.98 28.26 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> VULTURES ARE AMONGST THE MOST THREATENED GROUP OF BIRDS
tst2013.talkid1610 1 tst2013.talkid1610 28.88 40.79 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WHEN YOU SEE A VULTURE LIKE THIS THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO YOUR MIND IS THESE ARE DISGUSTING UGLY GREEDY CREATURES THAT ARE JUST AFTER YOUR FLESH ASSOCIATED WITH POLITICIANS
tst2013.talkid1610 1 tst2013.talkid1610 46.1 54.17 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I WANT TO CHANGE THAT PERCEPTION I WANT TO CHANGE THOSE FEELINGS YOU HAVE FOR THESE BIRDS BECAUSE THEY NEED OUR SYMPATHY THEY REALLY DO
tst2013.talkid1610 1 tst2013.talkid1610 54.59 55.61 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND i will TELL YOU WHY
tst2013.talkid1610 1 tst2013.talkid1610 56.29 59.42 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> FIRST OF ALL WHY DO THEY HAVE SUCH A BAD PRESS
tst2013.talkid1610 1 tst2013.talkid1610 60.29 74.27 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WHEN CHARLES DARWIN WENT ACROSS THE ATLANTIC IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO ON THE BEAGLE HE SAW THE TURKEY VULTURE AND HE SAID THESE ARE DISGUSTING BIRDS WITH BALD SCARLET HEADS THAT ARE FORMED TO REVEL IN PUTRIDITY
tst2013.talkid1610 1 tst2013.talkid1610 75.99 79.09 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> YOU COULD NOT GET A WORSE INSULT AND THAT FROM CHARLES DARWIN
tst2013.talkid1610 1 tst2013.talkid1610 80.63 84.03 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> YOU KNOW HE CHANGED HIS MIND WHEN HE CAME BACK AND i will TELL YOU WHY
tst2013.talkid1610 1 tst2013.talkid1610 84.63 91.79 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> they have ALSO BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH DISNEY PERSONIFIED AS GOOFY DUMB STUPID CHARACTERS
tst2013.talkid1610 1 tst2013.talkid1610 93.24 109.94 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> MORE RECENTLY IF you have BEEN FOLLOWING THE KENYAN PRESS THESE ARE THE ATTRIBUTES THAT THEY ASSOCIATED THE KENYAN MPS WITH BUT I WANT TO CHALLENGE THAT
tst2013.talkid1610 1 tst2013.talkid1610 110.31 112.06 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I WANT TO CHALLENGE THAT DO YOU KNOW WHY
tst2013.talkid1610 1 tst2013.talkid1610 112.81 117.46 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BECAUSE MPS DO NOT KEEP THE ENVIRONMENT CLEAN
tst2013.talkid1610 1 tst2013.talkid1610 120.24 123.54 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> MPS DO NOT HELP TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF DISEASES
tst2013.talkid1610 1 tst2013.talkid1610 125.27 126.54 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THEY ARE HARDLY MONOGAMOUS

tst2013.talkid1610 1 tst2013.talkid1610 135.2 137.98 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND MY favourITE IS VULTURES ARE BETTER LOOKING
tst2013.talkid1610 1 tst2013.talkid1610 142.04 146.07 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO {there's / there is / there has} TWO TYPES OF VULTURES IN THIS PLANET
tst2013.talkid1610 1 tst2013.talkid1610 146.23 159.26 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THERE ARE THE NEW WORLD VULTURES THAT ARE MAINLY FOUND IN THE AMERICAS LIKE THE CONDORS AND THE CARACARAS AND THEN THE OLD WORLD VULTURES WHERE WE HAVE SIXTEEN SPECIES FROM THESE SIXTEEN ELEVEN OF THEM ARE FACING A HIGH RISK OF EXTINCTION
tst2013.talkid1610 1 tst2013.talkid1610 160.58 167.12 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO WHY ARE VULTURES IMPORTANT FIRST OF ALL THEY PROVIDE VITAL ECOLOGICAL SERVICES THEY CLEAN UP
tst2013.talkid1610 1 tst2013.talkid1610 167.16 169.14 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> {they are / they were} OUR NATURAL GARBAGE COLLECTORS

tst2013.talkid1610 1 tst2013.talkid1610 182.91 192.6 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT IN AREAS WHERE THERE ARE NO VULTURES CARCASSES TAKE UP TO THREE TO FOUR TIMES TO DECOMPOSE AND THIS HAS HUGE RAMIFICATIONS FOR THE SPREAD OF DISEASES
tst2013.talkid1610 1 tst2013.talkid1610 194.19 197.08 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> VULTURES ALSO HAVE TREMENDOUS HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE
tst2013.talkid1610 1 tst2013.talkid1610 197.09 199.76 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THEY HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED IN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN CULTURE

tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 291.84 294.95 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WHAT IF INSTEAD OF CALLING THEM FEARS WE CALLED THEM STORIES
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 295.63 297.63 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BECAUSE {that's / that is / that has} REALLY WHAT FEAR IS IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT

tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 303.55 306.4 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND FEARS AND STORYTELLING HAVE THE SAME COMPONENTS
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 306.41 307.51 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THEY HAVE THE SAME ARCHITECTURE
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 308.09 310.49 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> LIKE ALL STORIES FEARS HAVE CHARACTERS
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 310.63 312.65 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IN OUR FEARS THE CHARACTERS ARE {us / u. s.}
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 313.32 317.08 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> FEARS ALSO HAVE PLOTS THEY HAVE BEGINNINGS AND MIDDLES AND ENDS

tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 321.74 327.43 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> OUR FEARS ALSO TEND TO CONTAIN IMAGERY THAT CAN BE EVERY BIT AS VIVID AS WHAT YOU MIGHT FIND IN THE PAGES OF A NOVEL
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 327.72 334.83 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> PICTURE A CANNIBAL HUMAN TEETH SINKING INTO HUMAN SKIN HUMAN FLESH ROASTING OVER A FIRE
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 336.54 338.12 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> FEARS ALSO HAVE SUSPENSE
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 338.73 343.98 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IF i have DONE MY JOB AS A STORYTELLER TODAY YOU SHOULD BE WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MEN OF THE WHALESHIP ESSEX
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 344.78 348.01 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> OUR FEARS PROVOKE IN {us / u. s.} A VERY SIMILAR FORM OF SUSPENSE
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 348.87 358.12 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> JUST LIKE ALL GREAT STORIES OUR FEARS FOCUS OUR ATTENTION ON A QUESTION THAT IS AS IMPORTANT IN LIFE AS IT IS IN LITERATURE WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 359.2 361.39 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IN OTHER WORDS OUR FEARS MAKE {us / u. s.} THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 361.82 372.76 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND HUMANS BY THE WAY ARE THE ONLY CREATURES CAPABLE OF THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE IN THIS WAY OF PROJECTING OURSELVES FORWARD IN TIME AND THIS MENTAL TIME TRAVEL IS JUST ONE MORE THING THAT FEARS HAVE IN COMMON WITH STORYTELLING
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 374.09 382.37 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AS A WRITER I CAN TELL YOU THAT A BIG PART OF WRITING FICTION IS LEARNING TO PREDICT HOW ONE EVENT IN A STORY WILL AFFECT ALL THE OTHER EVENTS AND FEAR WORKS IN THAT SAME WAY
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 382.62 386.52 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IN FEAR JUST LIKE IN FICTION ONE THING ALWAYS LEADS TO ANOTHER
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 387.49 395.99 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WHEN I WAS WRITING MY FIRST NOVEL THE AGE OF MIRACLES I SPENT MONTHS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE ROTATION OF THE EARTH SUDDENLY BEGAN TO SLOW DOWN
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 396.5 399.26 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO OUR DAYS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO OUR CROPS
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 399.3 400.78 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO OUR MINDS
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 401.32 408.09 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND THEN IT WAS ONLY LATER THAT I realiseD HOW VERY SIMILAR THESE QUESTIONS WERE TO THE ONES I USED TO ASK MYSELF AS A CHILD FRIGHTENED IN THE NIGHT
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 408.86 414.42 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IF AN EARTHQUAKE STRIKES TONIGHT I USED TO WORRY WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO OUR HOUSE WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO OUR TO MY FAMILY
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 415.17 418.57 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND THE ANSWER TO THOSE QUESTIONS ALWAYS TOOK THE FORM OF A STORY
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 419.93 426.86 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO IF WE THINK OF OUR FEARS AS MORE THAN JUST FEARS BUT AS STORIES WE SHOULD THINK OF OURSELVES AS THE AUTHORS OF THOSE STORIES
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 427.43 435.63 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT JUST AS IMPORTANTLY WE NEED TO THINK OF OURSELVES AS THE READERS OF OUR FEARS AND HOW WE CHOOSE TO READ OUR FEARS CAN HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT ON OUR LIVES
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 436.43 439.2 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> NOW SOME OF {us / u. s.} NATURALLY READ OUR FEARS MORE CLOSELY THAN OTHERS
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 439.24 456.53 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I READ ABOUT A STUDY RECENTLY OF SUCCESSFUL ENTREPRENEURS AND THE AUTHOR FOUND THAT THESE PEOPLE SHARED A HABIT THAT HE CALLED PRODUCTIVE PARANOIA WHICH MEANT THAT THESE PEOPLE INSTEAD OF DISMISSING THEIR FEARS THESE PEOPLE READ THEM CLOSELY THEY STUDIED THEM AND THEN THEY TRANSLATED THAT FEAR INTO PREPARATION AND ACTION
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 456.94 460.49 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO THAT WAY IF THEIR WORST FEARS CAME TRUE THEIR BUSINESSES WERE READY
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 461.21 464.19 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND some timeS OF COURSE OUR WORST FEARS DO COME TRUE
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 465.26 468.27 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> {that's / that is / that has} ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS SO EXTRAORDINARY ABOUT FEAR
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 468.92 472.33 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> ONCE IN A WHILE OUR FEARS CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 474.39 478.37 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT WE {can not / cannot} POSSIBLY PREPARE FOR ALL OF THE FEARS THAT OUR IMAGINATIONS CONCOCT
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 479.08 484.22 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO HOW CAN WE TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FEARS WORTH LISTENING TO AND ALL THE OTHERS
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 485.24 490.57 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I THINK THE END OF THE STORY OF THE WHALESHIP ESSEX OFFERS AN ILLUMINATING IF TRAGIC EXAMPLE
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 492.46 495.93 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AFTER MUCH DELIBERATION THE MEN FINALLY MADE A DECISION
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 496.55 504.78 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> TERRIFIED OF CANNIBALS THEY DECIDED TO FORGO THE CLOSEST ISLANDS AND INSTEAD EMBARKED ON THE LONGER AND MUCH MORE DIFFICULT ROUTE TO SOUTH AMERICA
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 505.94 512.81 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AFTER MORE THAN TWO MONTHS AT SEA THE MEN RAN OUT OF FOOD AS THEY KNEW THEY MIGHT AND THEY WERE STILL QUITE FAR FROM LAND
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 513.61 523.75 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WHEN THE LAST OF THE SURVIVORS WERE FINALLY PICKED UP BY TWO PASSING SHIPS LESS THAN HALF OF THE MEN WERE LEFT ALIVE AND SOME OF THEM HAD RESORTED TO THEIR OWN FORM OF CANNIBALISM
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 525.58 542.21 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> HERMAN MELVILLE WHO USED THIS STORY AS RESEARCH FOR MOBY DICK WROTE YEARS LATER AND FROM DRY LAND QUOTE ALL THE SUFFERINGS OF THESE MISERABLE MEN OF THE ESSEX MIGHT IN ALL HUMAN PROBABILITY HAVE BEEN AVOIDED HAD THEY IMMEDIATELY AFTER LEAVING THE WRECK STEERED STRAIGHT FOR TAHITI
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 542.61 546.09 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT AS MELVILLE PUT IT THEY DREADED CANNIBALS
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 547.5 553.5 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO THE QUESTION IS WHY DID THESE MEN DREAD CANNIBALS SO MUCH MORE THAN THE EXTREME LIKELIHOOD OF STARVATION
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 554.43 557.71 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WHY WERE THEY SWAYED BY ONE STORY SO MUCH MORE THAN THE OTHER
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 558.73 562.4 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> LOOKED AT FROM THIS ANGLE THEIRS BECOMES A STORY ABOUT READING
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 563.51 571.27 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE NOVELIST VLADIMIR NABOKOV SAID THAT THE BEST READER HAS A COMBINATION OF TWO VERY DIFFERENT TEMPERAMENTS THE ARTISTIC AND THE SCIENTIFIC
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 571.81 585.97 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> A GOOD READER HAS AN {artist's / artist is / artist has} PASSION A WILLINGNESS TO GET CAUGHT UP IN THE STORY BUT JUST AS IMPORTANTLY THE READER ALSO NEEDS THE COOLNESS OF judgement OF A SCIENTIST WHICH ACTS TO TEMPER AND COMPLICATE THE {reader's / reader is / reader has} INTUITIVE REACTIONS TO THE STORY
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 586.89 589.94 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AS we have SEEN THE MEN OF THE ESSEX HAD NO TROUBLE WITH THE ARTISTIC PART
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 590.0 593.44 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THEY DREAMED UP A VARIETY OF HORRIFYING SCENARIOS
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 594.0 597.35 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE PROBLEM WAS THAT THEY LISTENED TO THE WRONG STORY
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 598.24 608.16 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> OF ALL THE NARRATIVES THEIR FEARS WROTE THEY RESPONDED ONLY TO THE MOST LURID THE MOST VIVID THE ONE THAT WAS EASIEST FOR THEIR IMAGINATIONS TO PICTURE CANNIBALS
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 609.3 625.02 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT PERHAPS IF {they had / they would} BEEN ABLE TO READ THEIR FEARS MORE LIKE A SCIENTIST WITH MORE COOLNESS OF judgement THEY WOULD HAVE LISTENED INSTEAD TO THE LESS VIOLENT BUT THE MORE LIKELY TALE THE STORY OF STARVATION AND HEADED FOR TAHITI JUST AS MELVILLE'S SAD COMMENTARY SUGGESTS
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 626.86 632.43 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND MAYBE IF WE ALL TRIED TO READ OUR FEARS WE TOO WOULD BE LESS OFTEN SWAYED BY THE MOST SALACIOUS AMONG THEM
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 632.94 645.73 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> MAYBE THEN {we had / we would} SPEND LESS TIME WORRYING ABOUT SERIAL KILLERS AND PLANE CRASHES AND MORE TIME CONCERNED WITH THE SUBTLER AND SLOWER DISASTERS WE FACE THE SILENT build up OF PLAQUE IN OUR ARTERIES THE GRADUAL CHANGES IN OUR CLIMATE
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 646.37 653.28 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> JUST AS THE MOST NUANCED STORIES IN LITERATURE ARE OFTEN THE RICHEST SO TOO MIGHT OUR SUBTLEST FEARS BE THE TRUEST
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 654.08 665.29 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> READ IN THE RIGHT WAY OUR FEARS ARE AN AMAZING GIFT OF THE IMAGINATION A KIND OF every day CLAIRVOYANCE A WAY OF GLIMPSING WHAT MIGHT BE THE FUTURE WHEN {there's / there is / there has} STILL TIME TO INFLUENCE HOW THAT FUTURE WILL PLAY OUT
tst2013.talkid1637 1 tst2013.talkid1637 665.93 677.3 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> PROPERLY READ OUR FEARS CAN OFFER {us / u. s.} SOMETHING AS PRECIOUS AS OUR favourITE WORKS OF LITERATURE A LITTLE WISDOM A BIT OF INSIGHT AND A VERSION OF THAT MOST ELUSIVE THING THE TRUTH

tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 317.85 325.5 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND THE BEAUTY OF IT IS THAT EVEN THOUGH IT KIND OF NEED ONLY TAKE ABOUT TEN MINUTES A DAY IT IMPACTS OUR ENTIRE LIFE
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 326.4 328.08 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT WE NEED TO KNOW HOW TO DO IT
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 328.09 332.67 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WE NEED AN EXERCISE WE NEED A FRAMEWORK TO LEARN HOW TO BE MORE MINDFUL
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 332.68 334.25 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> {that's / that is / that has} ESSENTIALLY WHAT MEDITATION IS
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 334.46 336.74 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> {it's / it is / it has} FAMILIARIZING OURSELVES WITH THE PRESENT MOMENT
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 336.95 341.1 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT WE ALSO NEED TO KNOW HOW TO APPROACH IT IN THE RIGHT WAY TO GET THE BEST FROM IT
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 341.93 354.68 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND {that's / that is / that has} WHAT THESE ARE FOR IN CASE you have BEEN WONDERING BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE ASSUME THAT MEDITATION IS ALL ABOUT SORT OF STOPPING THOUGHTS GETTING RID OF EMOTIONS some how CONTROLLING THE MIND BUT ACTUALLY {it's / it is / it has} QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THAT
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 355.53 367.96 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> {it's / it is / it has} MORE ABOUT SORT OF STEPPING BACK SORT OF SEEING THE THOUGHT CLEARLY WITNESSING IT COMING AND GOING EMOTIONS COMING AND GOING with out judgement BUT WITH A RELAXED FOCUSED MIND
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 368.68 376.31 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW IF I FOCUS TOO MUCH ON THE BALLS THEN {there's / there is / there has} NO WAY THAT I CAN RELAX AND TALK TO YOU AT THE SAME TIME
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 376.32 380.97 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> EQUALLY IF I RELAX TOO MUCH TALKING TO YOU THEN {there's / there is / there has} NO WAY I CAN FOCUS ON THE BALLS i am GOING TO DROP THEM
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 381.58 391.79 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> NOW IN LIFE AND IN MEDITATION there will BE TIMES WHEN THE FOCUS BECOMES A LITTLE BIT TOO INTENSE AND LIFE STARTS TO FEEL A BIT LIKE THIS
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 391.8 395.51 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> {it's / it is / it has} A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WAY TO LIVE LIFE WHEN YOU GET THIS TIGHT AND STRESSED
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 396.03 401.63 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AT OTHER TIMES WE MIGHT TAKE OUR FOOT OFF THE GAS A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH AND THINGS JUST BECOME A SORT OF LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 402.19 406.1 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> OF COURSE IN MEDITATION {we are / we were} GOING TO END UP FALLING ASLEEP
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 406.59 414.46 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO {we are / we were} LOOKING FOR A BALANCE A FOCUSED RELAXATION WHERE WE CAN ALLOW THOUGHTS TO COME AND GO with out ALL THE USUAL INVOLVEMENT
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 415.2 421.42 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> NOW WHAT USUALLY HAPPENS WHEN {we are / we were} LEARNING TO BE MINDFUL IS THAT WE GET DISTRACTED BY A THOUGHT
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 421.43 422.71 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> let us SAY THIS IS AN ANXIOUS THOUGHT
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 422.98 427.88 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO {everything's / everything is / everything has} GOING FINE AND THEN WE SEE THE ANXIOUS THOUGHT AND {it's / it is / it has} LIKE OH did not realise I WAS WORRIED ABOUT THAT
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 428.39 430.29 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> YOU GO BACK TO IT REPEAT IT OH I AM WORRIED
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 430.51 433.08 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> OH I REALLY AM WORRIED WOW {there's / there is / there has} SO MUCH ANXIETY
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 433.3 438.29 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND BEFORE WE KNOW IT RIGHT {we are / we were} ANXIOUS ABOUT FEELING ANXIOUS
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 439.24 443.72 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> YOU KNOW THIS IS CRAZY WE DO THIS ALL THE TIME EVEN ON AN every day KIND OF LEVEL
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 443.73 447.86 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE LAST TIME I DUNNO YOU HAD A WOBBLY TOOTH
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 449.07 452.08 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> YOU KNOW {it's / it is / it has} WOBBLY AND YOU KNOW THAT IT HURTS
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 452.57 455.24 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT WHAT DO YOU DO EVERY TWENTY THIRTY SECONDS
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 456.0 461.55 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IT DOES HURT AND WE REINFORCE THE STORYLINE RIGHT
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 461.56 471.11 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND WE JUST KEEP TELLING OURSELVES AND WE DO IT ALL THE TIME AND {it's / it is / it has} ONLY IN LEARNING TO WATCH THE MIND IN THIS WAY THAT WE CAN START TO LET GO OF THOSE STORYLINES AND PATTERNS OF MIND
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 471.75 476.2 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT WHEN YOU SIT DOWN AND YOU WATCH THE MIND IN THIS WAY YOU MIGHT SEE MANY DIFFERENT PATTERNS
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 476.21 479.98 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> YOU MIGHT FIND A MIND {that's / that is / that has} REALLY SORT OF RESTLESS AND THE WHOLE TIME
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 480.84 487.11 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> do not BE SURPRISED IF YOU FEEL A BIT AGITATED IN YOUR BODY WHEN YOU SIT DOWN TO DO NOTHING AND YOUR MIND FEELS LIKE THAT
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 487.71 497.49 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> YOU MIGHT FIND A MIND {that's / that is / that has} VERY SORT OF DULL AND BORING AND {it's / it is / it has} JUST ALMOST MECHANICAL IT JUST SEEMS {it's / it is / it has} AS IF {you are / you were} GETTING UP GOING TO WORK EAT SLEEP GET UP WORK
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 498.16 505.0 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> OR IT MIGHT JUST BE THAT ONE LITTLE NAGGING THOUGHT THAT JUST GOES ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND YOUR MIND
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 505.91 519.43 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WELL what ever IT IS MEDITATION OFFERS THE OPPORTUNITY THE POTENTIAL TO STEP BACK AND TO GET A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE TO SEE THAT THINGS are not ALWAYS AS THEY APPEAR
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 520.37 529.46 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> YOU KNOW WE {can not / cannot} CHANGE EVERY LITTLE THING THAT HAPPENS TO {us / u. s.} IN LIFE BUT WE CAN CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE EXPERIENCE IT
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 529.5 533.18 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> {that's / that is / that has} THE POTENTIAL OF MEDITATION OF MINDFULNESS
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 533.19 537.88 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> YOU do not HAVE TO BURN ANY INCENSE AND YOU DEFINITELY do not HAVE TO SIT ON THE FLOOR
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 537.93 552.28 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS TO TAKE TEN MINUTES OUT A DAY TO STEP BACK TO FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH THE PRESENT MOMENT SO THAT YOU GET TO EXPERIENCE A GREATER SENSE OF FOCUS CALM AND CLARITY IN YOUR LIFE
tst2013.talkid1640 1 tst2013.talkid1640 552.73 553.46 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THANK YOU VERY MUCH
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 17.5 24.85 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I WAS SITTING WITH MY GIRLS AND JOY SAID DANG I WISH {he had / he would} GET OFF MY BACK
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 25.55 28.02 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> MY DADDY HE CALLS ME ALL THE TIME
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 29.63 32.13 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> LUCKY FOR YOU HE CALLS AT ALL SAID JASMINE
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 32.63 34.95 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I have not HEARD FROM MY DAD IN YEARS
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 36.31 42.61 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AT THIS MOMENT I KNEW THE GIRLS NEEDED A WAY TO CONNECT WITH THEIR FATHERS
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 43.62 55.97 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AT CAMP DIVA MY NON PROFIT organisATION WE HAVE THESE TYPES OF CONVERSATIONS ALL THE TIME AS A WAY TO HELP GIRLS OF AFRICAN DESCENT PREPARE FOR THEIR PASSAGE INTO WOMANHOOD
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 57.14 66.78 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THESE GIRLS JUST NEEDED A WAY TO INVITE THEIR FATHERS INTO THEIR LIVES ON THEIR OWN TERMS
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 67.15 74.71 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO I ASKED THE GIRLS HOW CAN WE HELP OTHER GIRLS DEVELOP HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR FATHERS
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 76.67 84.51 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> let us HAVE A DANCE ONE GIRL SHOUTED AND ALL THE GIRLS QUICKLY BACKED HER UP
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 85.02 93.95 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THEY STARTED DREAMING ABOUT THE DECORATIONS INVITATIONS THE DRESSES THEY WERE GOING TO WEAR AND WHAT THEIR FATHERS COULD AND COULD NOT WEAR
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 95.39 113.48 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IT WAS OFF AND RUNNING BEFORE I COULD EVEN BLINK MY EYES BUT EVEN IF I COULD HAVE SLOWED DOWN THOSE GIRLS I would not HAVE BECAUSE ONE THING THAT I HAVE LEARNED FROM OVER A DECADE OF WORKING WITH GIRLS IS THAT THEY ALREADY KNOW WHAT THEY NEED
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 114.79 117.93 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE WISDOM LIVES INSIDE OF THEM
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 118.77 131.24 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AS LONG AS THEY HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE MENTORSHIP AND RESOURCES THEY CAN BUILD WHAT THEY NEED NOT ONLY TO SURVIVE BUT TO TO THRIVE
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 132.96 140.88 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO WE HAD A DANCE AND GIRLS AND THEIR FATHERS CAME IN MULTITUDE
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 141.39 143.62 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THEY WERE DRESSED TO THE NINE
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 144.61 146.05 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THEY ACTED SWEET
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 150.18 151.77 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THEY ACTED SILLY
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 152.18 154.81 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THEY REALLY ENJOYED EACH {other's / other is / other has} COMPANY
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 155.42 157.72 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IT WAS A HUGE SUCCESS
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 158.36 162.46 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND THE GIRLS DECIDED TO MAKE IT AN ANNUAL EVENT
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 163.43 179.89 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO AS THE SEASONS CHANGED AND IT WAS TIME TO PLAN THE DANCE AGAIN ONE GIRL NAMED BRIANNA SPOKE UP AND SHE SAID MY DAD {can not / cannot} COME TO THE DANCE AND THIS WHOLE THING IS MAKING ME SAD
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 181.15 183.14 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WHY NOT THE GIRLS ASKED
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 184.26 187.55 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BECAUSE { he's / he was / he is / he has} IN JAIL SHE BRAVELY ADMITTED
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 188.78 192.14 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WELL CAN HE JUST GET OUT FOR A DAY ONE OF THE GIRLS ASKED
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 194.08 195.3 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND COME IN SHACKLES
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 195.46 200.36 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> {that's / that is / that has} WORSE THAN NOT HAVING HIM HERE AT ALL
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 201.63 211.52 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AT THIS MOMENT I SAW AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE GIRLS TO RISE TO THE OCCASION AND TO BECOME THEIR OWN HEROES
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 211.63 215.95 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO I ASKED WHAT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD DO ABOUT THIS
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 216.48 220.17 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WE WANT EVERY GIRL TO EXPERIENCE THE DANCE RIGHT
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 221.2 227.89 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO THE GIRLS THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT AND ONE GIRL SUGGESTED WHY do not WE JUST TAKE THE DANCE IN THE JAIL
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 229.6 236.26 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> MOST OF THE GIRLS DOUBTED THE POSSIBILITY OF THAT AND SAID ARE YOU CRAZY
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 236.55 246.99 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WHO IS GOING TO ALLOW A BUNCH OF LITTLE GIRLS DRESSED UP TO COME INSIDE A JAIL AND DANCE WITH THEIR DADDIES IN SPONGEBOB SUITS
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 247.34 248.77 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BECAUSE {that's / that is / that has} WHAT THEY CALLED THEM
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 250.91 257.48 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I SAID GIRLS WELL WELL YOU NEVER KNOW UNLESS YOU ASK
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 258.97 271.46 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO A LETTER WAS WRITTEN TO THE RICHMOND CITY SHERIFF SIGNED COLLECTIVELY BY EACH GIRL AND I WOULD HAVE TO SAY HE IS A VERY SPECIAL SHERIFF
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 272.85 285.86 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> HE CONTACTED ME IMMEDIATELY AND SAID WHENEVER THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING FAMILIES INSIDE HIS DOORS ARE ALWAYS OPEN
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 286.42 294.86 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BECAUSE ONE THING HE DID KNOW THAT WHEN FATHERS ARE CONNECTED TO THEIR CHILDREN IT IS LESS LIKELY THAT THEY WILL RETURN
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 297.01 303.82 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO SIXTEEN INMATES AND EIGHTEEN GIRLS WERE INVITED
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 305.1 315.35 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE GIRLS WERE DRESSED IN THEIR SUNDAY BEST AND THE FATHERS TRADED IN THEIR YELLOW AND BLUE JUMPSUITS FOR SHIRTS AND TIES
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 318.43 319.3 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THEY HUGGED
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 320.57 324.09 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THEY SHARED A FULL CATERED MEAL OF CHICKEN AND FISH
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 325.87 327.28 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THEY LAUGHED TOGETHER
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 329.13 330.15 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IT WAS BEAUTIFUL
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 333.85 345.54 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE FATHERS AND DAUGHTERS EVEN EXPERIENCED AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A PHYSICAL CONNECTION SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF THEM did not EVEN HAVE FOR A WHILE
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 346.06 358.86 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> FATHERS WERE IN A SPACE WHERE THEY WERE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR DAUGHTERS PLAY AND PULL OUT HER CHAIR AND EXTEND HIS HAND FOR A DANCE
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 359.5 361.07 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> EVEN THE GUARDS CRIED
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 362.81 370.16 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT AFTER THE DANCE WE ALL realiseD THAT DAD STILL WOULD BE IN JAIL
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 371.04 375.43 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO WE NEEDED TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT THEY COULD TAKE WITH THEM
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 376.05 385.43 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO WE BROUGHT IN FLIP CAMS AND WE HAD THEM LOOK AT THE FLIP CAMS AND JUST INTERVIEW EACH OTHER THEIR MESSAGES THEIR THOUGHTS
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 386.84 397.44 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THIS WAS GOING TO BE USED AS A TOUCHSTONE SO WHEN THEY STARTED TO MISS EACH OTHER AND FEEL DISCONNECTED THEY COULD RECONNECT THROUGH THIS IMAGE
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 398.05 409.28 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> i will NEVER FORGET THAT ONE GIRL LOOKED IN HER {father's / father is / father has} EYES WITH THAT CAMERA AND SAID DADDY WHEN YOU LOOK AT ME WHAT DO YOU SEE
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 411.5 425.47 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BECAUSE OUR DADDIES ARE OUR MIRRORS THAT WE REFLECT BACK ON WHEN WE DECIDE ABOUT WHAT TYPE OF MAN WE DESERVE AND HOW THEY SEE {us / u. s.} FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 426.62 431.79 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I KNOW THAT VERY WELL BECAUSE I WAS ONE OF THE LUCKY GIRLS
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 432.65 442.46 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I HAVE HAD MY FATHER IN MY LIFE ALWAYS

tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 455.45 471.83 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND THAT IS WHY IT IS EXTREMELY SPECIAL FOR ME TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE GIRLS ARE CONNECTED TO THEIR FATHERS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE SEPARATED BECAUSE OF BARBED WIRES AND METAL DOORS
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 472.9 487.39 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WE HAVE JUST CREATED A FORM FOR GIRLS WHO HAVE HEAVY QUESTIONS ON THEIR HEART TO BE IN A POSITION TO ASK THEIR FATHERS THOSE QUESTIONS AND GIVEN THE FATHERS THE FREEDOM TO ANSWER
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 488.46 499.44 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE FATHERS ARE EVEN LEAVING WITH THIS ONE THOUGHT WHAT TYPE OF WOMAN AM I PREPARING TO PUT IN THE WORLD
tst2013.talkid1646 1 tst2013.talkid1646 500.42 508.29 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BECAUSE A FATHER IS LOCKED IN DOES NOT MEAN HE SHOULD BE LOCKED OUT OF HIS {daughter's / daughter is / daughter has} LIFE

tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 113.17 117.24 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND IN IN THIS PICTURE I HAD ACTUALLY NEVER HAD A BOYFRIEND IN REAL LIFE
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 118.33 123.5 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I WAS TOTALLY UNCOMFORTABLE AND THE PHOTOGRAPHER WAS TELLING ME TO ARCH MY BACK AND PUT MY HAND IN THAT {guy's / guy is / guy has} HAIR
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 124.45 141.22 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND OF COURSE BARRING SURGERY OR THE FAKE TAN THAT I GOT TWO DAYS AGO FOR WORK {there's / there is / there has} VERY LITTLE THAT WE CAN DO TO TRANSFORM HOW WE LOOK AND HOW WE LOOK THOUGH IT IS SUPERFICIAL AND IMMUTABLE HAS A HUGE IMPACT ON OUR LIVES
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 143.25 147.37 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO TODAY FOR ME BEING FEARLESS MEANS BEING HONEST
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 147.9 150.65 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND I AM ON THIS STAGE BECAUSE I AM A MODEL
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 150.9 156.67 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I AM ON THIS STAGE BECAUSE I AM A PRETTY WHITE WOMAN AND IN MY INDUSTRY WE CALL THAT A SEXY GIRL
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 157.25 161.23 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND i am GOING TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME BUT WITH AN HONEST TWIST
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 161.75 163.74 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO THE FIRST QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU BECOME A MODEL
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 164.01 166.92 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND I ALWAYS JUST SAY OH I WAS SCOUTED BUT THAT MEANS NOTHING
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 167.19 176.28 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE REAL WAY THAT I BECAME A MODEL IS I WON A GENETIC LOTTERY AND I AM THE RECIPIENT OF A LEGACY AND MAYBE {you are / you were} WONDERING WHAT IS A LEGACY
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 176.29 194.87 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WELL FOR THE PAST FEW CENTURIES WE HAVE DEFINED BEAUTY NOT JUST AS HEALTH AND YOUTH AND SYMMETRY THAT {we are / we were} BIOLOGICALLY PROGRAMMED TO ADMIRE BUT ALSO AS TALL SLENDER FIGURES AND FEMININITY AND WHITE SKIN
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 195.13 199.09 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND THIS IS A LEGACY THAT WAS BUILT FOR ME AND {it's / it is / it has} A LEGACY THAT i have BEEN CASHING OUT ON
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 199.75 208.4 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND I KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO ARE SKEPTICAL AT THIS POINT AND MAYBE THERE ARE SOME FASHIONISTAS WHO ARE LIKE WAIT NAOMI TYRA JOAN SMALLS LIU WEN
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 208.41 210.84 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND FIRST I COMMEND YOU ON YOUR MODEL KNOWLEDGE VERY IMPRESSIVE
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 213.67 229.66 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE TO INFORM YOU THAT IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN A VERY INSPIRED NYU {phd / p. h. d.} STUDENT COUNTED ALL THE MODELS ON THE RUNWAY EVERY SINGLE ONE THAT WAS HIRED AND OF THE SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN MODELS THAT WERE HIRED ONLY TWENTY SEVEN OR LESS THAN FOUR per cent WERE NON WHITE
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 230.68 234.28 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE NEXT QUESTION PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME IS CAN I BE A MODEL WHEN I GROW UP
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 234.63 237.5 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND THE FIRST ANSWER IS I do not KNOW THEY do not PUT ME IN CHARGE OF THAT
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 238.84 242.87 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT THE SECOND ANSWER AND WHAT I REALLY WANT TO SAY TO THESE LITTLE GIRLS IS WHY
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 242.96 244.55 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> YOU KNOW YOU CAN BE ANYTHING
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 244.56 252.48 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> YOU COULD BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OR THE INVENTOR OF THE NEXT INTERNET OR A NINJA CARDIO THORACIC SURGEON POET WHICH WOULD BE AWESOME BECAUSE {you had / you would} BE THE FIRST ONE
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 255.24 261.36 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IF AFTER THIS AMAZING LIST THEY STILL ARE LIKE NO NO CAMERON I WANT TO BE A MODEL WELL THEN I SAY BE MY BOSS
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 261.48 266.93 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BECAUSE i am NOT IN CHARGE OF ANYTHING AND YOU COULD BE THE EDITOR IN CHIEF OF AMERICAN VOGUE OR THE CEO OF H AND M OR THE NEXT STEVEN MEISEL
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 268.31 273.32 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SAYING THAT YOU WANT TO BE A MODEL WHEN YOU GROW UP IS AKIN TO SAYING THAT YOU WANT TO WIN THE POWERBALL WHEN YOU GROW UP
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 274.41 278.74 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> {it's / it is / it has} YOU KNOW OUT OF YOUR CONTROL AND {it's / it is / it has} AWESOME AND {it's / it is / it has} NOT A CAREER PATH
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 279.57 287.81 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I WILL DEMONSTRATE FOR YOU NOW TEN YEARS OF ACCUMULATED MODEL KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE UNLIKE CARDIO THORACIC SURGEONS IT CAN JUST BE DISTILLED RIGHT INTO RIGHT NOW
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 288.07 306.91 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO IF THE PHOTOGRAPHER IS RIGHT THERE AND THE LIGHT IS RIGHT THERE LIKE A NICE HMI AND THE CLIENT SAYS CAMERON WE WANT A WALKING SHOT WELL THEN THIS LEG GOES FIRST NICE AND LONG THIS ARM GOES BACK THIS ARM GOES FORWARD THE HEAD IS AT THREE QUARTERS AND YOU JUST GO BACK AND FORTH JUST DO THAT AND THEN YOU LOOK BACK AT YOUR IMAGINARY FRIENDS THREE HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED FIVE HUNDRED TIMES
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 307.53 310.14 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IT WILL LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 313.26 315.27 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> HOPEFULLY LESS AWKWARD THAN THAT ONE IN THE MIDDLE
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 315.28 316.53 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THAT WAS I do not KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THERE
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 318.36 330.24 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> UNFORTUNATELY AFTER you have GONE TO SCHOOL AND YOU HAVE A RESUME AND you have DONE A FEW JOBS YOU {can not / cannot} SAY ANYTHING any more SO IF YOU SAY YOU WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BUT YOUR RESUME READS UNDERWEAR MODEL TEN YEARS PEOPLE GIVE YOU A FUNNY LOOK
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 331.02 333.41 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE NEXT QUESTION PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME IS DO THEY RETOUCH ALL THE PHOTOS
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 333.42 338.47 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND YEAH THEY PRETTY MUCH RETOUCH ALL THE PHOTOS BUT THAT IS ONLY A SMALL COMPONENT OF {what's / what is / what has / what does} HAPPENING
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 339.18 346.57 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THIS PICTURE IS THE VERY FIRST PICTURE THAT I EVER TOOK AND {it's / it is / it has} ALSO THE VERY FIRST TIME THAT I HAD WORN A BIKINI AND I did not EVEN HAVE MY PERIOD YET
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 346.62 349.81 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I KNOW {we are / we were} GETTING PERSONAL BUT I WAS A YOUNG GIRL
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 349.82 353.06 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THIS IS WHAT I LOOKED LIKE WITH MY GRANDMA JUST A FEW MONTHS EARLIER
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 353.99 356.41 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> {here's / here is / here has} ME ON THE SAME DAY AS THIS SHOOT
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 356.45 357.72 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> MY FRIEND GOT TO COME WITH ME
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 358.01 361.07 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> {here's / here is / here has} ME AT A SLUMBER PARTY A FEW DAYS BEFORE I SHOT FRENCH VOGUE

tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 365.98 367.28 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND {here's / here is / here has} ME TODAY
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 367.73 371.61 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND I HOPE WHAT {you are / you were} SEEING IS THAT THESE PICTURES ARE NOT PICTURES OF ME
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 371.65 383.61 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THEY ARE CONSTRUCTIONS AND THEY ARE CONSTRUCTIONS BY A GROUP OF PROFESSIONALS BY HAIRSTYLISTS AND make up ARTISTS AND PHOTOGRAPHERS AND STYLISTS AND ALL OF THEIR ASSISTANTS AND PRE PRODUCTION AND POST PRODUCTION AND THEY BUILD THIS {that's / that is / that has} NOT ME
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 385.36 387.77 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> o. k. SO THE NEXT QUESTION PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME IS DO YOU GET FREE STUFF
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 389.3 399.29 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I DO HAVE TOO MANY EIGHT INCH HEELS WHICH I NEVER GET TO WEAR EXCEPT FOR EARLIER BUT THE FREE STUFF THAT I GET IS THE FREE STUFF THAT I GET IN REAL LIFE AND {that's / that is / that has} WHAT WE do not LIKE TO TALK ABOUT
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 399.71 405.15 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I GREW UP IN CAMBRIDGE AND ONE TIME I WENT INTO A STORE AND I FORGOT MY MONEY AND THEY GAVE ME THE DRESS FOR FREE
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 406.14 416.36 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WHEN I WAS A teen ageR I WAS DRIVING WITH MY FRIEND WHO WAS AN AWFUL DRIVER AND SHE RAN A RED AND OF COURSE WE GOT PULLED OVER AND ALL IT TOOK WAS A SORRY OFFICER AND WE WERE ON OUR WAY
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 417.56 425.64 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND I GOT THESE FREE THINGS BECAUSE OF HOW I LOOK NOT WHO I AM AND THERE ARE PEOPLE PAYING A COST FOR HOW THEY LOOK AND NOT WHO THEY ARE
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 425.96 434.95 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I LIVE IN NEW YORK AND LAST YEAR OF THE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND teen ageRS THAT WERE STOPPED AND FRISKED EIGHTY SIX per cent OF THEM WERE BLACK AND LATINO AND MOST OF THEM WERE YOUNG MEN
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 435.66 442.66 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND THERE ARE ONLY A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND YOUNG BLACK AND LATINO MEN IN NEW YORK SO FOR THEM {it's / it is / it has} NOT A QUESTION OF WILL I GET STOPPED
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 442.67 444.97 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT HOW MANY TIMES WILL I GET STOPPED WHEN WILL I GET STOPPED
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 445.49 456.08 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WHEN I WAS RESEARCHING THIS TALK I FOUND OUT THAT OF THE THIRTEEN YEAR OLD GIRLS IN THE UNITED STATES FIFTY THREE per cent do not LIKE THEIR BODIES AND THAT NUMBER GOES TO SEVENTY EIGHT per cent BY THE TIME THAT {they are / they were} SEVENTEEN
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 456.79 461.58 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO THE LAST QUESTION PEOPLE ASK ME IS YOU KNOW WHAT IS IT LIKE TO BE A MODEL
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 461.59 469.93 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND I THINK THE ANSWER THAT {they are / they were} LOOKING FOR IS IF YOU ARE A LITTLE BIT SKINNIER AND YOU HAVE SHINIER HAIR YOU WILL BE SO HAPPY AND FABULOUS
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 470.11 473.67 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND WHEN {we are / we were} BACKSTAGE WE GIVE AN ANSWER THAT MAYBE MAKES IT SEEM LIKE THAT
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 473.68 480.07 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WE SAY {it's / it is / it has} REALLY AMAZING TO TRAVEL AND {it's / it is / it has} AMAZING TO GET TO WORK WITH CREATIVE INSPIRED PASSIONATE PEOPLE
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 480.35 489.25 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE BUT {they are / they were} ONLY ONE HALF OF THE STORY BECAUSE THE THING THAT WE NEVER SAY ON CAMERA THAT I HAVE NEVER SAID ON CAMERA IS I AM INSECURE
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 490.41 494.0 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND i am INSECURE BECAUSE I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT I LOOK LIKE EVERY DAY
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 495.82 502.65 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND IF YOU EVER ARE WONDERING YOU KNOW IF I HAVE THINNER THIGHS AND SHINIER HAIR WILL I BE HAPPIER
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 503.06 510.07 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> YOU JUST NEED TO MEET A GROUP OF MODELS BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE THINNEST THIGHS AND THE SHINIEST HAIR AND THE COOLEST CLOTHES AND {they are / they were} THE MOST PHYSICALLY INSECURE WOMEN PROBABLY ON THE PLANET
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 512.11 529.27 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO WHEN I WAS WRITING THIS TALK I FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO STRIKE AN HONEST BALANCE BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND I FELT VERY UNCOMFORTABLE TO COME OUT HERE AND SAY LOOK i have RECEIVED ALL THESE BENEFITS FROM A DECK STACKED IN MY favour AND IT ALSO FELT REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE TO FOLLOW THAT UP WITH AND IT does not ALWAYS MAKE ME HAPPY
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 529.85 537.62 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT MOSTLY IT WAS DIFFICULT TO UNPACK A LEGACY OF GENDER AND RACIAL OPPRESSION WHEN I AM ONE OF THE BIGGEST BENEFICIARIES
tst2013.talkid1647 1 tst2013.talkid1647 539.15 555.82 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT i am ALSO HAPPY AND honoured TO BE UP HERE AND I THINK THAT {it's / it is / it has} GREAT THAT I GOT TO COME BEFORE TEN OR TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS HAD PASSED AND {i had / i would} HAD MORE AGENCY IN MY CAREER BECAUSE MAYBE THEN I would not TELL THE STORY OF HOW I GOT MY FIRST JOB OR MAYBE I would not TELL THE STORY OF HOW I PAID FOR COLLEGE WHICH SEEMS SO IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW

tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 143.96 149.14 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND MY SECOND MESSAGE IS THAT every one THINKS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HAPPENS TO WOMEN THAT {it's / it is / it has} A {women's / women is / women has } ISSUE
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 150.78 151.83 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> NOT EXACTLY
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 152.72 172.08 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> OVER EIGHTY FIVE per cent OF ABUSERS ARE MEN AND DOMESTIC ABUSE HAPPENS ONLY IN INTIMATE INTERDEPENDENT LONG TERM RELATIONSHIPS IN OTHER WORDS IN FAMILIES THE LAST PLACE WE WOULD WANT OR EXPECT TO FIND VIOLENCE WHICH IS ONE REASON DOMESTIC ABUSE IS SO CONFUSING
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 173.51 182.62 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU MYSELF THAT I WAS THE LAST PERSON ON EARTH WHO WOULD STAY WITH A MAN WHO BEATS ME BUT IN FACT I WAS A VERY TYPICAL VICTIM BECAUSE OF MY AGE
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 182.8 204.91 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I WAS TWENTY TWO AND IN THE UNITED STATES WOMEN AGES SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR ARE THREE TIMES AS LIKELY TO BE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS AS WOMEN OF OTHER AGES AND OVER FIVE HUNDRED WOMEN AND GIRLS THIS AGE ARE KILLED EVERY YEAR BY ABUSIVE PARTNERS BOYFRIENDS AND HUSBANDS IN THE UNITED STATES
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 206.93 213.17 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I WAS ALSO A VERY TYPICAL VICTIM BECAUSE I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ITS WARNING SIGNS OR ITS PATTERNS
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 215.13 218.42 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I MET CONOR ON A COLD RAINY JANUARY NIGHT
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 219.45 223.62 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> HE SAT NEXT TO ME ON THE NEW YORK CITY SUBWAY AND HE STARTED CHATTING ME UP
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 224.91 226.28 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> HE TOLD ME TWO THINGS
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 226.51 233.49 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> ONE WAS THAT HE TOO HAD JUST GRADUATED FROM AN IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL AND THAT HE WORKED AT A VERY IMPRESSIVE WALL STREET BANK
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 235.17 242.86 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT WHAT MADE THE BIGGEST IMPRESSION ON ME THAT FIRST MEETING WAS THAT HE WAS SMART AND FUNNY AND HE LOOKED LIKE A FARM BOY
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 243.16 248.93 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> HE HAD THESE BIG CHEEKS THESE BIG APPLE CHEEKS AND THIS WHEAT BLOND HAIR AND HE SEEMED SO SWEET
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 250.63 258.43 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> ONE OF THE SMARTEST THINGS CONOR DID FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WAS TO CREATE THE ILLUSION THAT I WAS THE DOMINANT PARTNER IN THE RELATIONSHIP
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 259.58 263.69 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> HE DID THIS ESPECIALLY AT THE BEGINNING BY IDOLIZING ME
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 264.68 272.35 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WE STARTED DATING AND HE LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT ME THAT I WAS SMART THAT {i had / i would} GONE TO HARVARD THAT I WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT HELPING teen age GIRLS AND MY JOB
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 273.14 277.49 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> HE WANTED TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT MY FAMILY AND MY CHILDHOOD AND MY HOPES AND DREAMS
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 278.75 284.23 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> CONOR BELIEVED IN ME AS A WRITER AND A WOMAN IN A WAY THAT NO ONE ELSE EVER HAD
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 285.55 310.53 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND HE ALSO CREATED A MAGICAL ATMOSPHERE OF TRUST BETWEEN {us / u. s.} BY CONFESSING HIS SECRET WHICH WAS THAT AS A VERY YOUNG BOY STARTING AT AGE FOUR HE HAD BEEN SAVAGELY AND REPEATEDLY PHYSICALLY ABUSED BY HIS STEPFATHER AND THE ABUSE HAD GOTTEN SO BAD THAT HE HAD HAD TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL IN EIGHTH GRADE EVEN THOUGH HE WAS VERY SMART AND {he had / he would} SPENT ALMOST TWENTY YEARS REBUILDING HIS LIFE
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 311.58 318.56 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WHICH IS WHY THAT IVY LEAGUE DEGREE AND THE WALL STREET JOB AND HIS BRIGHT SHINY FUTURE MEANT SO MUCH TO HIM
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 319.48 346.19 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IF YOU HAD TOLD ME THAT THIS SMART FUNNY SENSITIVE MAN WHO ADORED ME WOULD ONE DAY DICTATE WHETHER OR NOT I WORE make up HOW SHORT MY SKIRTS WERE WHERE I LIVED WHAT JOBS I TOOK WHO MY FRIENDS WERE AND WHERE I SPENT CHRISTMAS I WOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT YOU BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT A HINT OF VIOLENCE OR CONTROL OR ANGER IN CONOR AT THE BEGINNING
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 347.77 355.29 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I did not KNOW THAT THE FIRST STAGE IN ANY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RELATIONSHIP IS TO SEDUCE AND CHARM THE VICTIM
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 356.41 360.05 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I ALSO did not KNOW THAT THE SECOND STEP IS TO ISOLATE THE VICTIM
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 361.28 382.23 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> NOW CONOR DID NOT COME HOME ONE DAY AND ANNOUNCE YOU KNOW HEY ALL THIS ROMEO AND JULIET STUFF HAS BEEN GREAT BUT I NEED TO MOVE INTO THE NEXT PHASE WHERE I ISOLATE YOU AND I ABUSE YOU SO I NEED TO GET YOU OUT OF THIS APARTMENT WHERE THE neighbourS CAN HEAR YOU SCREAM AND OUT OF THIS CITY WHERE YOU HAVE FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND COWORKERS WHO CAN SEE THE BRUISES
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 384.17 414.63 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> INSTEAD CONOR CAME HOME ONE FRIDAY EVENING AND HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD QUIT HIS JOB THAT DAY HIS DREAM JOB AND HE SAID THAT HE HAD QUIT HIS JOB BECAUSE OF ME BECAUSE I HAD MADE HIM FEEL SO SAFE AND LOVED THAT HE did not NEED TO PROVE HIMSELF ON WALL STREET any more AND HE JUST WANTED TO GET OUT OF THE CITY AND AWAY FROM HIS ABUSIVE DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY AND MOVE TO A TINY TOWN IN NEW ENGLAND WHERE HE COULD START HIS LIFE OVER WITH ME BY HIS SIDE
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 416.38 430.68 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> NOW THE LAST THING I WANTED TO DO WAS LEAVE NEW YORK AND MY DREAM JOB BUT I THOUGHT YOU MADE SACRIFICES FOR YOUR SOULMATE SO I AGREED AND I QUIT MY JOB AND CONOR AND I LEFT MANHATTAN TOGETHER
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 431.78 442.51 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I HAD NO IDEA I WAS FALLING INTO CRAZY LOVE THAT I WAS WALKING HEADFIRST INTO A CAREFULLY LAID PHYSICAL FINANCIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAP
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 444.65 452.4 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE NEXT STEP IN THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PATTERN IS TO INTRODUCE THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE AND SEE HOW SHE REACTS
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 453.76 455.31 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND {here's / here is / here has} WHERE THOSE GUNS COME IN
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 456.66 463.14 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AS SOON AS WE MOVED TO NEW ENGLAND YOU KNOW THAT PLACE WHERE CONNOR WAS SUPPOSED TO FEEL SO SAFE HE BOUGHT THREE GUNS
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 464.26 466.5 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> HE KEPT ONE IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT OF OUR CAR
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 467.51 472.75 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> HE KEPT ONE UNDER THE PILLOWS ON OUR BED AND THE THIRD ONE HE KEPT IN HIS POCKET AT ALL TIMES
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 473.98 478.11 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND HE SAID THAT HE NEEDED THOSE GUNS BECAUSE OF THE TRAUMA {he had / he would} EXPERIENCED AS A YOUNG BOY
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 478.37 479.84 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> HE NEEDED THEM TO FEEL PROTECTED
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 480.9 490.14 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT THOSE GUNS WERE REALLY A MESSAGE FOR ME AND EVEN THOUGH HE had not RAISED A HAND TO ME MY LIFE WAS ALREADY IN GRAVE DANGER EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 493.13 497.27 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> CONOR FIRST PHYSICALLY ATTACKED ME FIVE DAYS BEFORE OUR WEDDING
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 499.06 502.06 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IT WAS SEVEN AM I STILL HAD ON MY NIGHTGOWN
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 503.69 523.89 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I WAS WORKING ON MY COMPUTER TRYING TO FINISH A free lance WRITING ASSIGNMENT AND I GOT FRUSTRATED AND CONOR USED MY ANGER AS AN EXCUSE TO PUT BOTH OF HIS HANDS AROUND MY NECK AND TO SQUEEZE SO TIGHTLY THAT I COULD NOT BREATHE OR SCREAM AND HE USED THE CHOKEHOLD TO HIT MY HEAD REPEATEDLY AGAINST THE WALL
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 525.88 533.89 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> FIVE DAYS LATER THE TEN BRUISES ON MY NECK HAD JUST FADED AND I PUT ON MY {mother's / mother is / mother has} WEDDING DRESS AND I MARRIED HIM
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 536.16 544.55 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> DESPITE WHAT HAD HAPPENED I WAS SURE WE WERE GOING TO LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER BECAUSE I LOVED HIM AND HE LOVED ME SO MUCH
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 545.63 547.94 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND HE WAS VERY VERY SORRY
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 548.62 553.48 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> HE HAD JUST BEEN REALLY STRESSED OUT BY THE WEDDING AND BY BECOMING A FAMILY WITH ME
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 554.57 557.99 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IT WAS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT AND HE WAS NEVER GOING TO HURT ME AGAIN
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 559.52 561.05 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IT HAPPENED TWICE MORE ON THE HONEYMOON
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 561.99 574.03 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE FIRST TIME I WAS DRIVING TO FIND A SECRET BEACH AND I GOT LOST AND HE PUNCHED ME IN THE SIDE OF MY HEAD SO HARD THAT THE OTHER SIDE OF MY HEAD REPEATEDLY HIT THE {driver's / driver is / driver has} SIDE WINDOW
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 575.53 583.21 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND THEN A FEW DAYS LATER DRIVING HOME FROM OUR HONEYMOON HE GOT FRUSTRATED BY TRAFFIC AND HE THREW A COLD BIG MAC IN MY FACE
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 584.79 588.85 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> CONOR PROCEEDED TO BEAT ME ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK FOR THE NEXT TWO AND A HALF YEARS OF OUR MARRIAGE
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 590.83 595.41 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I WAS MISTAKEN IN THINKING THAT I WAS UNIQUE AND ALONE IN THIS SITUATION
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 596.31 608.68 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> ONE IN THREE AMERICAN WOMEN EXPERIENCES DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR STALKING AT SOME POINT IN HER LIFE AND THE CD.C. REPORTS THAT FIFTEEN MILLION CHILDREN ARE ABUSED EVERY YEAR FIFTEEN MILLION
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 609.78 612.03 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO ACTUALLY I WAS IN VERY GOOD COMPANY
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 614.46 617.54 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BACK TO MY QUESTION WHY DID I STAY
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 619.32 620.23 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE ANSWER IS EASY
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 621.46 623.17 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I did not KNOW HE WAS ABUSING ME
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 624.34 643.27 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> EVEN THOUGH HE HELD THOSE LOADED GUNS TO MY HEAD PUSHED ME DOWN STAIRS THREATENED TO KILL OUR DOG PULLED THE KEY OUT OF THE CAR IGNITION AS I DROVE DOWN THE HIGHWAY POURED COFFEE GRINDS ON MY HEAD AS I DRESSED FOR A JOB INTERVIEW I NEVER ONCE THOUGHT OF MYSELF AS A BATTERED WIFE
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 644.8 654.66 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> INSTEAD I WAS A VERY STRONG WOMAN IN LOVE WITH A DEEPLY TROUBLED MAN AND I WAS THE ONLY PERSON ON EARTH WHO COULD HELP CONOR FACE HIS DEMONS
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 656.99 661.21 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE OTHER QUESTION EVERYBODY ASKS IS WHY does not SHE JUST LEAVE
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 662.1 664.89 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WHY did not I WALK OUT I COULD HAVE LEFT ANY TIME
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 666.62 677.06 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> TO ME THIS IS THE SADDEST AND MOST PAINFUL QUESTION THAT PEOPLE ASK BECAUSE WE VICTIMS KNOW SOMETHING YOU USUALLY do not {it's / it is / it has} INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS TO LEAVE AN ABUSER
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 678.67 682.44 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BECAUSE THE FINAL STEP IN THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PATTERN IS KILL HER
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 684.77 695.46 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> OVER SEVENTY per cent OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MURDERS HAPPEN AFTER THE VICTIM HAS ENDED THE RELATIONSHIP AFTER { she's / she was / she is / she has} GOTTEN OUT BECAUSE THEN THE ABUSER HAS NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 696.68 719.26 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> OTHER OUTCOMES INCLUDE LONG TERM STALKING EVEN AFTER THE ABUSER REMARRIES DENIAL OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND MANIPULATION OF THE FAMILY COURT SYSTEM TO TERRIFY THE VICTIM AND HER CHILDREN WHO ARE REGULARLY FORCED BY FAMILY COURT JUDGES TO SPEND UNSUPERVISED TIME WITH THE MAN WHO BEAT THEIR MOTHER
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 720.27 722.63 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND STILL WE ASK WHY does not SHE JUST LEAVE
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 724.69 730.68 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I WAS ABLE TO LEAVE BECAUSE OF ONE FINAL SADISTIC BEATING THAT BROKE THROUGH MY DENIAL
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 732.79 737.48 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I realiseD THAT THE MAN WHO I LOVED SO MUCH WAS GOING TO KILL ME IF I LET HIM
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 738.9 740.17 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO I BROKE THE SILENCE
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 741.03 755.29 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I TOLD every one THE POLICE MY neighbourS MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY TOTAL STRANGERS AND i am HERE TODAY BECAUSE YOU ALL HELPED ME
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 758.32 766.24 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WE TEND TO STEREOTYPE VICTIMS AS GRISLY HEADLINES SELF DESTRUCTIVE WOMEN DAMAGED GOODS
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 767.68 769.74 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE QUESTION WHY DOES SHE STAY
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 770.02 780.9 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IS CODE FOR SOME PEOPLE FOR {it's / it is / it has} HER FAULT FOR STAYING AS IF VICTIMS INTENTIONALLY CHOOSE TO FALL IN LOVE WITH MEN INTENT UPON DESTROYING {us / u. s.}
tst2013.talkid1654 1 tst2013.talkid1654 782.31 805.17 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT SINCE PUBLISHING CRAZY LOVE I HAVE HEARD HUNDREDS OF STORIES FROM MEN AND WOMEN WHO ALSO GOT OUT WHO LEARNED AN INVALUABLE LIFE LESSON FROM WHAT HAPPENED AND WHO REBUILT LIVES JOYOUS HAPPY LIVES AS EMPLOYEES WIVES AND MOTHERS LIVES COMPLETELY FREE OF VIOLENCE LIKE ME

tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 275.8 283.29 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO FOUR ALMOST FIVE YEARS AGO PROPOSITION EIGHT THE GREAT MARRIAGE EQUALITY DEBATE WAS RAISING A LOT OF DUST AROUND THIS COUNTRY
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 283.3 287.17 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND AT THE TIME GETTING MARRIED was not REALLY SOMETHING I SPENT A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 287.18 294.0 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT I WAS STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT AMERICA A COUNTRY WITH SUCH A TARNISHED CIVIL RIGHTS RECORD COULD BE REPEATING ITS MISTAKES SO BLATANTLY
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 294.77 307.61 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND I REMEMBER WATCHING THE DISCUSSION ON TELEVISION AND THINKING HOW INTERESTING IT WAS THAT THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE WAS ESSENTIALLY DRAWING GEOGRAPHICAL BOUNDARIES THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY BETWEEN PLACES WHERE PEOPLE BELIEVED IN IT AND PLACES WHERE PEOPLE did not
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 308.45 314.11 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND THEN THAT THIS DISCUSSION WAS DRAWING GEOGRAPHICAL BOUNDARIES AROUND ME

tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 387.59 397.44 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND THIS POWERFUL AWARENESS ROLLED IN OVER ME THAT I WAS A MINORITY AND IN MY OWN HOME COUNTRY BASED ON ONE FACET OF MY CHARACTER

tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 432.95 442.27 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND THEN IT OCCURRED TO ME PERHAPS IF THEY COULD LOOK INTO THE EYES OF THE PEOPLE THAT THEY WERE CASTING INTO SECOND CLASS CITIZENSHIP IT MIGHT MAKE IT HARDER FOR THEM TO DO
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 442.47 443.79 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IT MIGHT GIVE THEM PAUSE

tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 676.68 679.79 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND A LOT MORE PEOPLE WANTED TO SHOW THEIR FACES THAN I HAD ANTICIPATED
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 679.97 682.92 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO I CHANGED MY IMMEDIATE GOAL TO TEN THOUSAND FACES
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 683.76 692.92 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THAT VIDEO WAS MADE IN THE SPRING OF TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN AND AS OF TODAY I HAVE TRAVELED TO ALMOST TWENTY CITIES AND PHOTOGRAPHED ALMOST TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE

tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 705.33 710.18 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BECAUSE IF A PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS THEN A PICTURE OF A FACE NEEDS A WHOLE NEW VOCABULARY
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 732.64 743.56 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO AFTER TRAVELING AND TALKING TO PEOPLE IN PLACES LIKE OKLAHOMA OR SMALL TOWN TEXAS WE FOUND EVIDENCE THAT THE INITIAL PREMISE WAS DEAD ON
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 743.71 745.49 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> VISIBILITY REALLY IS KEY
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 745.53 748.33 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> FAMILIARITY REALLY IS THE GATEWAY DRUG TO EMPATHY

tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 757.01 768.14 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> OF COURSE IN MY TRAVELS I MET PEOPLE WHO LEGALLY DIVORCED THEIR CHILDREN FOR BEING OTHER THAN STRAIGHT BUT I ALSO MET PEOPLE WHO WERE SOUTHERN BAPTISTS WHO SWITCHED CHURCHES BECAUSE THEIR CHILD WAS A LESBIAN
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 768.76 772.94 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SPARKING EMPATHY HAD BECOME THE BACKBONE OF SELF EVIDENT TRUTHS
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 772.95 780.61 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT {here's / here is / here has} WHAT I WAS STARTING TO LEARN THAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING SELF EVIDENT TRUTHS does not ERASE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN {us / u. s.}
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 780.68 783.63 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IN FACT ON THE CONTRARY IT HIGHLIGHTS THEM
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 784.18 791.45 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IT PRESENTS NOT JUST THE COMPLEXITIES FOUND IN A PROCESSION OF DIFFERENT HUMAN BEINGS BUT THE COMPLEXITIES FOUND WITHIN EACH INDIVIDUAL PERSON
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 792.25 796.15 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IT was not THAT WE HAD TOO MANY BOXES IT WAS THAT WE HAD TOO FEW
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 800.58 812.1 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AT SOME POINT I realiseD THAT MY MISSION TO PHOTOGRAPH GAYS WAS INHERENTLY FLAWED BECAUSE THERE WERE A MILLION DIFFERENT SHADES OF GAY
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 813.27 820.16 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> HERE I WAS TRYING TO HELP AND I HAD PERPETUATED THE VERY THING I HAD SPENT MY LIFE TRYING TO AVOID YET ANOTHER BOX
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 821.5 828.61 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AT SOME POINT I ADDED A QUESTION TO THE RELEASE FORM THAT ASKED PEOPLE TO QUANTIFY THEMSELVES ON A SCALE OF ONE TO ONE HUNDRED per cent GAY
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 829.17 832.71 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND I WATCHED SO MANY EXISTENTIAL CRISES UNFOLD IN FRONT OF ME
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 836.07 839.72 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> PEOPLE did not KNOW WHAT TO DO BECAUSE THEY HAD NEVER BEEN PRESENTED WITH THE OPTION BEFORE
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 839.73 841.58 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> CAN YOU QUANTIFY YOUR OPENNESS
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 842.28 849.67 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> ONCE THEY GOT OVER THE SHOCK THOUGH BY AND LARGE PEOPLE OPTED FOR SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SEVENTY TO NINETY FIVE per cent OR THE THREE TO TWENTY per cent MARKS
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 850.21 857.73 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> OF COURSE THERE WERE LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO OPTED FOR A ONE HUNDRED per cent ONE OR THE OTHER BUT I FOUND THAT A MUCH LARGER PROPORTION OF PEOPLE IDENTIFIED AS SOMETHING THAT WAS MUCH MORE NUANCED
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 859.0 863.76 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I FOUND THAT MOST PEOPLE FALL ON A SPECTRUM OF WHAT I HAVE COME TO REFER TO AS GREY
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 864.99 872.31 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> LET ME BE CLEAR THOUGH AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT IN NO WAY AM I SAYING THAT PREFERENCE does not EXIST
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 873.11 884.46 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND I AM NOT EVEN GOING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF CHOICE VERSUS BIOLOGICAL IMPERATIVE BECAUSE IF ANY OF YOU HAPPEN TO BE OF THE BELIEF THAT SEXUAL ORIENTATION IS A CHOICE I INVITE YOU TO GO OUT AND TRY TO BE GREY
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 884.47 885.82 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> i will TAKE YOUR PICTURE JUST FOR TRYING
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 887.83 891.96 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WHAT I AM SAYING THOUGH IS THAT HUMAN BEINGS ARE NOT ONE DIMENSIONAL
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 893.32 913.84 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO TAKE FROM THE per centAGE SYSTEM IS THIS IF YOU HAVE GAY PEOPLE OVER HERE AND YOU HAVE STRAIGHT PEOPLE OVER HERE AND WHILE WE recognisE THAT MOST PEOPLE IDENTIFY AS SOMEWHERE CLOSER TO ONE BINARY OR ANOTHER THERE IS THIS VAST SPECTRUM OF PEOPLE THAT EXIST IN BETWEEN
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 915.05 917.52 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND THE REALITY THAT THIS PRESENTS IS A COMPLICATED ONE
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 917.53 925.42 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU PASS A LAW THAT ALLOWS A BOSS TO FIRE AN EMPLOYEE FOR HOMOSEXUAL BEHAVIOR WHERE EXACTLY DO YOU DRAW THE LINE
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 927.06 931.22 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IS IT OVER HERE BY THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD ONE OR TWO HETEROSEXUAL EXPERIENCES SO FAR
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 931.91 936.4 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> OR IS IT OVER HERE BY THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ONLY HAD ONE OR TWO HOMOSEXUAL EXPERIENCES THUS FAR
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 937.34 940.01 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WHERE EXACTLY DOES ONE BECOME A SECOND CLASS CITIZEN
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 942.75 950.16 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> ANOTHER INTERESTING THING THAT I LEARNED FROM MY PROJECT AND MY TRAVELS IS JUST WHAT A POOR BINDING AGENT SEXUAL ORIENTATION IS
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 951.51 966.94 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AFTER TRAVELING SO MUCH AND MEETING SO MANY PEOPLE LET ME TELL YOU THERE ARE JUST AS MANY JERKS AND SWEETHEARTS AND DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS AND JOCKS AND QUEENS AND EVERY OTHER POLARIZATION YOU CAN POSSIBLY THINK OF WITHIN THE LGBT COMMUNITY AS THERE ARE WITHIN THE HUMAN RACE
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 968.82 981.28 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT WE PLAY WITH ONE LEGAL HAND TIED BEHIND OUR BACKS AND ONCE YOU GET PAST THE SHARED NARRATIVE OF PREJUDICE AND STRUGGLE JUST BEING OTHER THAN STRAIGHT does not NECESSARILY MEAN THAT WE HAVE ANYTHING IN COMMON
tst2013.talkid1658 1 tst2013.talkid1658 983.92 1006.14 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO IN THE ENDLESS PROLIFERATION OF FACES THAT SELF EVIDENT TRUTHS IS ALWAYS BECOMING AS IT HOPEFULLY APPEARS ACROSS MORE AND MORE PLATFORMS BUS SHELTERS BILLBOARDS FACEBOOK PAGES SCREEN SAVERS PERHAPS IN WATCHING THIS PROCESSION OF HUMANITY SOMETHING INTERESTING AND USEFUL WILL BEGIN TO HAPPEN

tst2013.talkid1659 1 tst2013.talkid1659 572.05 572.42 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THANK YOU
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 91.56 95.28 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> YOU PROBABLY ALL AGREE WITH ME THAT THIS IS A VERY NICE ROAD
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 96.09 106.7 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> {it's / it is / it has} MADE OF ASPHALT AND ASPHALT IS A VERY NICE MATERIAL TO DRIVE ON BUT NOT ALWAYS ESPECIALLY NOT ON THESE DAYS AS TODAY WHEN {it's / it is / it has} RAINING A LOT
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 107.24 109.76 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THEN YOU CAN HAVE A LOT OF SPLASH WATER IN THE ASPHALT
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 110.15 115.48 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU THEN RIDE WITH YOUR BICYCLE AND PASS THESE CARS THEN {that's / that is / that has} NOT VERY NICE
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 116.25 119.31 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> ALSO ASPHALT CAN CREATE A LOT OF NOISE
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 119.51 126.58 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> {it's / it is / it has} A NOISY MATERIAL AND IF WE PRODUCE ROADS LIKE IN THE NETHERLANDS VERY CLOSE TO CITIES THEN WE WOULD LIKE A SILENT ROAD
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 127.92 132.37 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE SOLUTION FOR THAT IS TO MAKE ROADS OUT OF POROUS ASPHALT
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 133.15 147.97 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> POROUS ASPHALT A MATERIAL THAT WE USE NOW IN MOST OF THE HIGHWAYS IN THE NETHERLANDS IT HAS PORES AND WATER CAN JUST RAIN THROUGH IT SO ALL THE RAINWATER WILL FLOW AWAY TO THE SIDES AND YOU HAVE A ROAD {that's / that is / that has} EASY TO DRIVE ON SO NO SPLASH WATER any more
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 148.48 151.42 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> ALSO THE NOISE WILL DISAPPEAR IN THESE PORES
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 151.76 156.37 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BECAUSE {it's / it is / it has} VERY HOLLOW ALL THE NOISE WILL DISAPPEAR SO {it's / it is / it has} A VERY SILENT ROAD
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 157.82 164.69 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IT ALSO HAS DISADVANTAGES OF COURSE AND THE DISADVANTAGE OF THIS ROAD IS THAT RAVELING CAN OCCUR
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 165.18 170.15 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WHAT IS RAVELING YOU SEE THAT IN THIS ROAD THAT THE STONES AT THE SURFACE COME OFF
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 171.21 179.54 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> FIRST YOU GET ONE STONE THEN SEVERAL MORE AND MORE AND MORE AND MORE AND MORE AND THEN THEY WELL I WILL NOT DO THAT
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 181.46 185.27 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT THEY CAN DAMAGE YOUR WINDSHIELD SO {you are / you were} NOT HAPPY WITH THAT
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 185.84 189.22 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND FINALLY THIS RAVELING CAN ALSO LEAD TO MORE AND MORE DAMAGE
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 189.79 191.71 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> some timeS YOU CAN CREATE POTHOLES WITH THAT
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 192.34 193.79 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> { he's / he was / he is / he has} READY
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 196.35 200.71 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> POTHOLES OF COURSE THAT CAN BECOME A PROBLEM BUT WE HAVE A SOLUTION
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 201.15 204.28 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> HERE YOU SEE ACTUALLY HOW THE DAMAGE APPEARS IN THIS MATERIAL
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 204.54 208.79 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> {it's / it is / it has} A POROUS ASPHALT LIKE I SAID SO YOU HAVE ONLY A SMALL AMOUNT OF BINDER BETWEEN THE STONES
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 209.32 221.61 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> DUE TO WEATHERING DUE TO UV LIGHT DUE TO OXIDATION THIS BINDER THIS BITUMEN THE GLUE BETWEEN THE AGGREGATES IS GOING TO SHRINK AND IF IT SHRINKS YOU GET MICRO CRACKS AND IT DELAMINATES FROM THE AGGREGATES
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 221.75 225.5 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THEN IF YOU DRIVE OVER THE ROAD YOU TAKE OUT THE AGGREGATES WHAT WE JUST SAW HERE
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 227.73 231.08 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM WE THOUGHT OF SELF HEALING MATERIALS
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 231.12 236.36 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IF WE CAN MAKE THIS MATERIAL SELF HEALING THEN PROBABLY WE HAVE A SOLUTION
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 237.15 248.33 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO WHAT WE CAN DO IS USE STEEL WOOL JUST TO CLEAN PANS AND THE STEEL WOOL WE CAN CUT IN VERY SMALL PIECES AND THESE VERY SMALL PIECES WE CAN MIX TO THE BITUMEN
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 248.91 252.63 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO THEN YOU HAVE ASPHALT WITH VERY SMALL PIECES OF STEEL WOOL IN IT
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 253.84 259.13 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THEN YOU NEED THE MACHINE LIKE YOU SEE HERE THAT YOU CAN USE FOR COOKING INDUCTION MACHINE
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 259.77 263.43 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> INDUCTION CAN HEAT ESPECIALLY STEEL {it's / it is / it has} VERY GOOD AT THAT
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 263.75 272.77 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THEN WHAT YOU DO IS YOU HEAT UP THE STEEL YOU MELT THE BITUMEN AND THE BITUMEN WILL FLOW INTO THESE MICRO CRACKS AND THE STONES ARE AGAIN FIXED TO THE SURFACE
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 274.32 279.48 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> TODAY I USE A MICROWAVE BECAUSE I can not TAKE THE BIG INDUCTION MACHINE HERE on stage
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 279.49 282.29 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO A MICROWAVE IS A SIMILAR SYSTEM
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 282.51 287.03 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO I PUT THE SPECIMEN IN WHICH i am NOW GOING TO TAKE OUT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 288.32 291.38 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO THIS IS THE SPECIMEN COMING OUT NOW
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 292.27 298.74 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO I SAID WE HAVE WE HAVE SUCH AN INDUSTRIAL MACHINE IN THE LAB TO HEAT UP THE THE SPECIMENS
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 298.75 307.75 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WE TESTED A LOT OF SPECIMENS THERE AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT THEY ACTUALLY SAW OUR RESULTS AND THEY THOUGHT WELL {that's / that is / that has} VERY INTERESTING WE HAVE TO TRY THAT
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 308.11 315.77 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO THEY DONATED TO {us / u. s.} A PIECE OF HIGHWAY FOUR HUNDRED METERS OF THE A FIFTY EIGHT WHERE WE HAD TO MAKE A TEST TRACK TO TEST THIS MATERIAL
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 316.19 327.24 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO {that's / that is / that has} WHAT WE DID HERE YOU SEE WHERE WE WERE MAKING THE TEST ROAD AND THEN OF COURSE THIS ROAD WILL LAST SEVERAL YEARS with out ANY DAMAGE {that's / that is / that has} WHAT WE KNOW FROM PRACTICE
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 328.41 332.05 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO WE TOOK A LOT OF SAMPLES FROM THIS ROAD AND WE TESTED THEM IN THE LAB
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 332.68 341.56 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO WE DID ageing ON THE SAMPLES DID A LOT OF LOADING ON IT HEALED THEM WITH OUR INDUCTION MACHINE AND HEALED THEM AND TESTED THEM AGAIN
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 341.75 343.23 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SEVERAL TIMES WE CAN REPEAT THAT
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 343.88 361.32 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO ACTUALLY THE CONCLUSION FROM THIS RESEARCH IS THAT IF WE GO ON THE ROAD EVERY FOUR YEARS WITH OUR HEALING MACHINE THIS IS THE BIG VERSION WE HAVE MADE TO GO ON THE REAL ROAD IF WE GO ON THE ROAD EVERY FOUR YEARS WE CAN DOUBLE THE SURFACE LIFE OF THIS ROAD WHICH OF COURSE SAVES A LOT OF MONEY
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 362.11 380.67 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WELL TO CONCLUDE I CAN SAY THAT WE MADE MATERIAL USING STEEL FIBERS THE ADDITION OF STEEL FIBERS USING INDUCTION ENERGY TO REALLY INCREASE THE SURFACE LIFE OF THE ROAD DOUBLE THE SURFACE LIFE YOU CAN EVEN DO SO IT WILL REALLY SAVE A LOT OF MONEY WITH VERY SIMPLE TRICKS
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 381.8 384.16 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND NOW {you are / you were} OF COURSE CURIOUS IF IT ALSO WORKED
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 384.97 387.66 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO WE STILL HAVE THE SPECIMEN HERE {it's / it is / it has} QUITE WARM
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 387.82 392.3 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> ACTUALLY IT STILL HAS TO COOL DOWN FIRST BEFORE I CAN SHOW YOU THAT THE HEALING WORKS
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 392.79 394.01 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT I WILL DO A TRIAL
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 395.81 397.51 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> let us SEE YEAH IT WORKED
tst2013.talkid1665 1 tst2013.talkid1665 398.47 398.87 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THANK YOU

tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 16.35 20.11 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> o. k. THIS MORNING i am SPEAKING ON THE QUESTION OF CORRUPTION
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 21.05 34.98 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND CORRUPTION IS DEFINED AS THE ABUSE OF A POSITION OF TRUST FOR THE BENEFIT OF YOURSELF OR IN THE CASE OF OUR CONTEXT YOUR FRIENDS YOUR FAMILY OR YOUR FINANCIERS
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 35.54 37.75 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> o. k. FRIENDS FAMILY AND FINANCIERS
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 40.07 49.99 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE UNDERSTAND ABOUT CORRUPTION AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE BEEN MISEDUCATED ABOUT IT AND WE HAVE TO ADMIT THAT
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 50.03 53.7 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WE HAVE TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO ADMIT THAT TO START CHANGING HOW WE DEAL WITH IT
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 54.19 59.14 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE FIRST THING IS THAT THE BIG MYTH NUMBER ONE IS THAT IN FACT {it's / it is / it has} NOT REALLY A CRIME
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 59.55 68.03 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WHEN WE GET TOGETHER WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND WE DISCUSS CRIME IN OUR COUNTRY CRIME IN BELMONT OR CRIME IN DIEGO OR CRIME IN MARABELLA {nobody's / nobody is / nobody has} SPEAKING ABOUT CORRUPTION
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 68.04 69.13 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> {that's / that is / that has} THE HONEST TRUTH
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 69.79 74.28 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> WHEN THE COMMISSIONER OF POLICE COMES ON TV TO TALK ABOUT CRIME HE is not SPEAKING ABOUT CORRUPTION
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 74.68 79.7 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND WE KNOW FOR SURE WHEN THE MINISTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY IS SPEAKING ABOUT CRIME { he's / he was / he is / he has} NOT TALKING ABOUT CORRUPTION EITHER
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 81.11 83.25 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE POINT i am MAKING IS THAT IT IS A CRIME
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 83.29 87.53 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IT IS AN ECONOMIC CRIME BECAUSE {we are / we were} INVOLVING THE LOOTING OF tax payers' MONEY
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 88.91 91.03 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CORRUPTION IS A REALITY
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 91.04 97.78 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AS SOMEBODY WHO COMES FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR I CAN TELL YOU {there's / there is / there has} A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF CORRUPTION IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH GOVERNMENT
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 97.82 103.21 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE SAME BRIBES AND BACKHANDERS AND THINGS THAT TAKE PLACE UNDER THE TABLE IT ALL TAKES PLACE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR

tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 110.04 137.44 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE SECOND IMPORTANT MYTH TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DESTROY THESE MYTHS DISMANTLE THEM AND DESTROY THEM AND RIDICULE THEM THE SECOND IMPORTANT MYTH TO UNDERSTAND IS THE ONE THAT SAYS THAT IN FACT CORRUPTION IS ONLY A SMALL PROBLEM IF IT IS A PROBLEM {it's / it is / it has} ONLY A SMALL PROBLEM THAT IN FACT {it's / it is / it has} ONLY A LITTLE TEN OR FIFTEEN per cent {it's / it is / it has} BEEN GOING ON for ever IT PROBABLY WILL CONTINUE for ever AND {there's / there is / there has} NO POINT PASSING ANY LAWS BECAUSE {there's / there is / there has} LITTLE WE CAN DO ABOUT IT
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 137.89 142.34 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND I WANT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THAT TOO IS A DANGEROUS MYTH VERY DANGEROUS

tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 192.57 208.97 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE FIRST THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THAT WHEN ALL OF THIS MONEY FLOWED INTO OUR COUNTRY ABOUT FORTY YEARS AGO WE EMBARKED THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY EMBARKED ON A SERIES OF GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT ARRANGEMENTS TO HAVE RAPIDLY DEVELOP THE COUNTRY
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 209.33 219.12 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND SOME OF THE LARGEST PROJECTS IN THE COUNTRY WERE BEING CONSTRUCTED THROUGH GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT ARRANGEMENTS WITH SOME OF THE LEADING COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD THE UNITED STATES AND BRITAIN AND FRANCE AND SO ON AND SO ON
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 219.26 225.31 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AS I SAID EVEN THIS BUILDING {we are / we were} STANDING IN {that's / that is / that has} ONE OF THE IRONIES THIS BUILDING WAS PART OF THAT SERIES OF COMPLEXES WHAT THEY CALLED THE TWIN TOWERS
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 228.22 243.3 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IT BECAME SO OUTRAGEOUS THE WHOLE SITUATION THAT IN FACT A COMMISSION OF enquiry WAS APPOINTED AND IT REPORTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO THIRTY YEARS AGO IT REPORTED THE BALLAH REPORT THIRTY YEARS AGO AND IMMEDIATELY THE GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT ARRANGEMENTS WERE STOPPED
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 244.56 249.48 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE THEN PRIME MINISTER WENT TO PARLIAMENT TO GIVE A BUDGET SPEECH AND HE SAID SOME THINGS THAT i will NEVER FORGET
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 249.85 251.95 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THEY WENT RIGHT IN HERE I WAS A YOUNG MAN AT THE TIME
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 251.96 253.24 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IT WENT RIGHT INTO MY HEART
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 253.51 256.84 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND HE SAID THAT IN FACT LET ME SEE IF THIS THING WORKS

tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 274.45 276.93 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO THE TEN OR FIFTEEN per cent IS PURE MISCHIEF
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 278.04 279.93 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AS WE SAY {it's / it is / it has} A NANCY STORY FORGET IT

tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 293.45 294.68 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO WHAT HAS CHANGED
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 295.51 298.99 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I do not LIKE TO BRING UP EMBARRASSING SECRETS TO AN INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCE BUT I HAVE TO
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 299.74 302.7 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> FOUR MONTHS AGO WE SUFFERED A CONSTITUTIONAL OUTRAGE IN THIS COUNTRY

tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 327.03 328.93 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THEY ARE THE PIARCO AIRPORT ACCUSED
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 329.17 335.09 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IT WAS A CONSTITUTIONAL OUTRAGE OF THE FIRST ORDER AND I HAVE LABELED IT THE PLOT TO PERVERT PARLIAMENT
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 335.88 338.5 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> OUR HIGHEST INSTITUTION IN OUR COUNTRY WAS PERVERTED

tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 342.55 344.61 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> DO YOU GET HOW SERIOUS THIS PROBLEM IS
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 344.91 348.74 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THERE WAS MASSIVE PROTEST A LOT OF {us / u. s.} IN THIS ROOM TOOK PART IN THE PROTEST IN DIFFERENT FORMS
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 349.62 356.64 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> MOST IMPORTANTLY THE AMERICAN EMBASSY COMPLAINED SO PARLIAMENT WAS SWIFTLY RECONVENED AND THE LAW WAS REVERSED IT WAS REPEALED
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 356.65 358.2 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> {that's / that is / that has} THE WORD LAWYERS USE IT WAS REPEALED
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 358.96 378.19 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT THE POINT IS THAT PARLIAMENT WAS OUTWITTED IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF EVENTS BECAUSE WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE SUSPICIOUS PASSAGE OF THAT LAW THE LAW WAS ACTUALLY PASSED INTO EFFECT ON THE WEEKEND WE CELEBRATED OUR FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF INDEPENDENCE OUR JUBILEE OF INDEPENDENCE
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 378.28 380.26 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO THAT IS THAT IS THE KIND OF OUTRAGE OF THE THING
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 380.27 390.18 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> IT WAS A KIND OF A NASTY WAY TO GET MATURATION BUT WE GOT IT BECAUSE WE ALL UNDERSTOOD IT AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT I COULD REMEMBER THERE WERE MASS PROTESTS AGAINST THIS CORRUPTION
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 390.76 392.96 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND THAT THAT GAVE ME A LOT OF HOPE
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 392.97 396.62 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THOSE OF {us / u. s.} WHO ARE some timeS YOU FEEL LIKE {you are / you were} A LITTLE BIT ON YOUR OWN DOING SOME OF THIS WORK
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 398.91 405.02 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THAT PASSAGE OF THE LAW AND THE REPEAL OF THE LAW FORTIFIED THE CASE OF THE PIARCO AIRPORT ACCUSED
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 405.34 409.14 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO IT WAS ONE OF THOSE REALLY SUPERIOR DOUBLE BLUFF KIND OF THINGS THAT TOOK PLACE
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 410.4 411.66 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT WHAT WERE THEY ACCUSED OF

tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 832.88 834.32 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE NAME OF THE PERSON does not MATTER

tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 844.99 846.93 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> I would not DIGNIFY IT i am ON A POINT
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 847.28 852.48 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> THE POINT IS THAT PERSON MADE A CAREER OUT OF USING THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT TO ADVANCE HIS CAUSE
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 853.16 866.31 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND THE MOST FAMOUS CASE WAS WHAT WE CAME TO CALL THE SECRET SCHOLARSHIP SCANDAL WHERE IN FACT THERE WAS ABOUT SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN GOVERNMENT MONEY THAT HAD BEEN DISBURSED IN A SERIES OF SCHOLARSHIPS AND THE SCHOLARSHIPS had not BEEN ADVERTISED AND SO AND SO ON AND SO ON
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 866.51 875.0 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND HE WAS ABLE TO GET THE COURT USING THAT ACT OF PARLIAMENT FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT TO RELEASE THE INFORMATION AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS EXCELLENT
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 876.46 877.24 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> FANTASTIC
tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 879.8 898.54 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT YOU SEE THE QUESTION IS THIS IF {it's / it is / it has} RIGHT AND PROPER FOR {us / u. s.} TO USE THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT AND TO USE THE COURT TO FORCE A DISCLOSURE ABOUT SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN PUBLIC MONEY IT MUST BE RIGHT AND PROPER FOR {us / u. s.} TO FORCE A DISCLOSURE ABOUT TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS

tst2013.talkid1673 1 tst2013.talkid1673 943.23 954.91 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO HERE WE HAVE IT WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THE BASIC SAFEGUARDS OF INTEGRITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY HAVE ALL BEEN DISCARDED

tst2013.talkid1699 1 tst2013.talkid1699 119.45 129.32 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> BUT I CAME TO realise THAT THAT did not REALLY HELP BECAUSE IT WAS EVEN HELPING THE LIONS TO SEE THROUGH THE COWSHED
tst2013.talkid1699 1 tst2013.talkid1699 130.2 133.09 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> SO I did not GIVE UP I CONTINUED
tst2013.talkid1699 1 tst2013.talkid1699 133.6 137.68 <O,F0,UNKNOWN> AND A SECOND IDEA I GOT WAS TO USE A scare crow
