tst2013.talkid1518_005 ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE WITH YOUR MOBILE PHONE 
tst2013.talkid1518_006 I AM A CHILD OF NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR AND I LIVE IN THE CITY OF BERLIN 
tst2013.talkid1518_007 LET 'S GO BACK TO THAT TIME TO THIS CITY 
tst2013.talkid1518_008 HERE YOU CAN SEE HOW HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE STOOD UP AND PROTESTED FOR CHANGE 
tst2013.talkid1518_009 THIS IS AUTUMN NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE AND IMAGINE THAT ALL THOSE PEOPLE STANDING UP AND PROTESTING FOR CHANGE HAD A MOBILE PHONE IN THEIR POCKET 
tst2013.talkid1518_010 WHO IN THE ROOM HAS A MOBILE PHONE WITH YOU

tst2013.talkid1518_016 AND I WILL TALK ABOUT THIS 
tst2013.talkid1518_017 THESE ARE THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY LINES OF INFORMATION 
tst2013.talkid1518_018 RAW DATA 
tst2013.talkid1518_019 AND WHILE THESE INFORMATIONS THERE 
tst2013.talkid1518_020 BECAUSE IN THE SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND SIX THE E U COMMISSION TABLED A DIRECTIVE 
tst2013.talkid1518_021 THIS DIRECTIVE CALLED DATA RETENTION DIRECTIVE 
tst2013.talkid1518_022 THIS DIRECTIVE SAYS THAT EACH PHONE COMPANY IN EUROPE EACH INTERNET SERVICE COMPANY ALL OVER EUROPE HAS TO STORE A WIDE RANGE OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE USERS 
tst2013.talkid1518_023 WHO CALLED SOON WHO SENSE HUMAN EMAIL 
tst2013.talkid1518_024 WHO SENSE FROM A TEXT MESSAGE 
tst2013.talkid1518_025 AND IF YOU USE YOUR MOBILE PHONE WHERE YOU ARE 
tst2013.talkid1518_026 ALL THIS INFORMATION ARE STORED FOR AT LEAST SIX MONTHS UP TO TWO YEARS BY YOUR PHONE COMPANY OR YOUR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER 
tst2013.talkid1518_027 AND ALL OVER EUROPE PEOPLE STOOD UP AND SAID WE DON'T WANT THIS 
tst2013.talkid1518_028 THEY SAID WE DON'T ONCE THIS DATA RETENTION 
tst2013.talkid1518_029 WE WANT TO SELF DETERMINATION IN THE DIGITAL AGE AND WE DON'T WANT THAT PHONE COMPANIES AND INTERNET COMPANIES HAVE TO STORE ALL THIS INFORMATION ABOUT US 
tst2013.talkid1518_030 THEY WERE LAWYERS JOURNALIST GREECE THEY ALL SAID WE DON'T WANT 
tst2013.talkid1518_031 AND YOU CAN SEE LIKE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WENT OUT ON THE STREETS OF GIRL AND SAID FREEDOM NOT FEAR 
tst2013.talkid1518_032 AND SOME EVEN SAID THIS WOULD BE STASI TWO POINT 
tst2013.talkid1518_033 WAS A SECRET POLICE AND EAST GERMANY 
tst2013.talkid1518_034 AND I ALSO ASK MYSELF DOESN'T REALLY WORK 
tst2013.talkid1518_035 CAN THEY REALLY STORE ALL THIS INFORMATION ABOUT US 
tst2013.talkid1518_036 EVERY TIME I USE MY MOBILE PHONE 
tst2013.talkid1518_037 SO I ASKED MY PHONE COMPANY TORTURED TELECOM WHICH WAS AT THAT TIME THE LARGEST PHONE COMPANY IN GERMANY AND I ASKED HIM PLEASE SENT ME ALL THE INFORMATION YOU HAVE START ABOUT ME 
tst2013.talkid1518_038 AND ASKED THEM ONCE AND I ASKED THEM AGAINST AND I GOT NO REAL ANSWERED WAS ONLY BLOOD PLANTS 
tst2013.talkid1518_039 BUT THEN I SAID I WANT TO HAVE THIS INFORMATION BECAUSE THIS IS MY LIFE YOU ARE PROTOCOLING 
tst2013.talkid1518_040 SO I DECIDED TO START A LAWSUIT AGAINST THEM BECAUSE I WANTED TO HAVE THIS INFORMATION 
tst2013.talkid1518_041 BUT TOUCH A TELEKOM SAID NO WE WILL NOT GIVE YOU THIS INFORMATION 
tst2013.talkid1518_042 SO AT THE END I HAD A SETTLEMENT WITH THEM 
tst2013.talkid1518_043 I PUT DOWN THE LAWSUIT AND THEY WILL SEND ME ALL THE INFORMATION TO ASK FOR 
tst2013.talkid1518_044 BECAUSE IN THE MEANTIME THE GERMAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT RULED THAT IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS TO DIRECTIVE INTO GERMAN LAW WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL 
tst2013.talkid1518_045 SO I GOT THIS UGLY BROWN ENVELOPE WITH A CITY INSIDE 
tst2013.talkid1518_046 AND ON THE CITY THIS WAS ON 
tst2013.talkid1518_047 THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY LINES OF INFORMATION 
tst2013.talkid1518_048 AND FIRST I THOUGHT AND I SAID OKAY IT'S HUGE FILE OK 
tst2013.talkid1518_049 BUT THEN AFTER A WHILE I REALIZED THIS IS MY LIFE 
tst2013.talkid1518_050 THIS IS A SIX MONTHS OF MY LIFE AND THIS FILE 
tst2013.talkid1518_051 SO I WAS A LITTLE BIT SKEPTICAL WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH IT 
tst2013.talkid1518_052 BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE WHERE I AM WHEREAS SLEEP AT NIGHT WHEN WHAT AM I DOING 
tst2013.talkid1518_053 BUT THEN I SAID I WANT TO SHEEP TO OUT WITH THIS INFORMATION 
tst2013.talkid1518_054 I WANT TO MAKE SOME PUBLIC 
tst2013.talkid1518_055 BECAUSE I WANT TO SHOW THE PEOPLE WHAT DATA RETENTION MEAN 
tst2013.talkid1518_056 SO TOGETHER WITH SIDE ONLINE AND OPEN DATA CITY I DID THIS 
tst2013.talkid1518_057 SO THIS IS A BASEBALL IS ASIAN OF SIX MONTHS OF MY LIFE 
tst2013.talkid1518_058 YOU CAN ZOOM IN AND YOU ZOOM OUT YOU CAN WENT BACK AND FAST BOUGHT 
tst2013.talkid1518_059 YOU CAN SEE EVERY STEP I TAKE 
tst2013.talkid1518_060 AND YOU CAN EVEN SEE HOW I GO FROM FRANKFURT BY TRAIN TO COLOGNE AND HOW OFTEN I CALL IN BETWEEN 
tst2013.talkid1518_061 ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE WITH THIS INFORMATION 
tst2013.talkid1518_062 BUT A LITTLE BIT SCARY 
tst2013.talkid1518_063 BUT IT IS NOT ONLY ABOUT ME 
tst2013.talkid1518_064 IT 'S ABOUT ALL OF US 
tst2013.talkid1518_065 FIRST IT 'S ONLY LIKE I CALL MY WIFE AND SHE CALLS ME AND WE TALK TO EACH OTHER A COUPLE OF TIMES 
tst2013.talkid1518_066 AND THEN THERE ARE SOME FRIENDS CALLING ME AND SAY CALL EACH OTHER 
tst2013.talkid1518_067 AND AFTER A WHILE YOU ARE CALLING YOU AND YOU ARE CALLING YOU AND YOU HAVE THIS GREAT COMMUNICATION NETWORK 
tst2013.talkid1518_068 YOU CAN SEE HOW YOUR PEOPLE ARE COMMUNICATING WITH EACH OTHER WHAT TIMES A COLLEGE OTHER WHEN THEY GO TO BED 
tst2013.talkid1518_069 YOU CAN SEE ALL THIS 
tst2013.talkid1518_070 YOU CAN SEE THE HUBS LIKE WHO ARE THE LEADERS IN THE GROUP 
tst2013.talkid1518_071 IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION YOU CAN SEE WHAT YOU'RE SOCIETIES DOING 
tst2013.talkid1518_072 IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR SOCIETY 
tst2013.talkid1518_073 THIS IS THE BLUEPRINT FOR COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA AND IRAN 
tst2013.talkid1518_074 IT 'S A BLUEPRINT HOW TO SURVEY YOUR SOCIETY BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHO TALKS TO WHOM WHO SENSE HUMAN EMAIL ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION 
tst2013.talkid1518_075 AND THIS INFORMATION AS TAUGHT FOR AT LEAST SIX MONTHS AND EUROPE UP TO TWO YEARS 
tst2013.talkid1518_076 LIKE I SAID AT THE BEGINNING YOU IMAGINE THAT ALL THOSE PEOPLE ON THE STREETS OF BERLIN IN AUTUMN OF NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE MOBILE PHONE IN THEIR POCKET 
tst2013.talkid1518_077 AND THE STARS WOULD HAVE KNOWN WHO TOOK PART AT THESE PROTESTS AND IF THE STARS WOULD HAVE KNOWN WHO ARE THE LEADERS BEHIND IT THIS MAY NEVER HAVE HAPPENED 
tst2013.talkid1518_078 THE FALL OF THE BERLIN WALL WOULD MAYBE NOT THERE 
tst2013.talkid1518_079 AND IN THE AFTERMATH ALSO LOTS OF ALL OF THE IRON CURTAIN 
tst2013.talkid1518_080 BECAUSE TODAY STATE AGENCIES AND COMPANIES WANT TO STORE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS THEY CAN GET ABOUT US ONLINE AND OFFLINE 
tst2013.talkid1518_081 THEY WANT TO HAVE THE POSSIBILITY TO TRACK OUR LIVES AND THEY WANT TO STORE THEM FOR ALL TIME 
tst2013.talkid1518_082 BUT SELF DETERMINATION AND LIVING IN THE DIGITAL AGE IS NO CONTRADICTION 
tst2013.talkid1518_083 BUT YOU HAVE TO FIGHT FOR YOURSELF DETERMINATION TODAY 
tst2013.talkid1518_084 YOU HAVE TO FIGHT FOR EVERY DAY 
tst2013.talkid1518_085 SO WHEN YOU GO HOME TELL YOUR FRIENDS THAT PRIVACY IS THE VALUE OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND IT 'S NOT OUTDATED 
tst2013.talkid1518_086 WHEN YOU GO HOME TELL YOUR REPRESENTATIVE ONLY BECAUSE COMPANIES AND STATE AGENCIES HAVE THE POSSIBILITY TO STORE CERTAIN INFORMATION THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO IT 
tst2013.talkid1518_087 AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME ASK TELEPHONE COMPANY WHAT INFORMATION IS A STORY ABOUT YOU 
tst2013.talkid1518_088 SO IN THE FUTURE EVERY TIME YOU USE YOUR MOBILE PHONE HEADED BE A REMINDER TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE TO FIGHT FOR SELF DETERMINATION IN THE DIGITAL AGE 
tst2013.talkid1518_089 THANK YOU 
tst2013.talkid1600_000 OKAY I HAVE JUST ONE REQUEST 
tst2013.talkid1600_001 PLEASE DON'T TELL ME I'M NO 
tst2013.talkid1600_002 NOW I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO MY BROTHERS 
tst2013.talkid1600_003 LET ME IS TWENTY TOLL VERY HANDSOME 
tst2013.talkid1600_004 HIS SPEECHLESS BUT HE COMMUNICATES JOY IN A WAY THAT SOME OF THE BEST ORATORS CANNOT 
tst2013.talkid1600_005 WHEN HE KNOWS WHAT LOVERS 
tst2013.talkid1600_006 HE SHARES UNCONDITIONALLY AND HE SHARES IT REGARDLESS 
tst2013.talkid1600_007 HE 'S NOT GREEDY DOESN'T SEE SKIN COLOR 
tst2013.talkid1600_008 HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES AND GET TEXAS HE HAD NEVER TOLD ALLY 
tst2013.talkid1600_009 WHEN HE SINGS SONGS FROM OUR CHILDHOOD ATTEMPTING WORDS THAT NOT EVEN I COULD REMEMBER HE REMINDS ME OF ONE THING HOW LITTLE WE KNOW ABOUT THE MIND AND HOW WONDERFUL THE UNKNOWN MUST BE 
tst2013.talkid1600_010 SIAL IS SIXTEEN HE TOLD HIS VERY HANDSOME 
tst2013.talkid1600_011 HE HAS THE MOST IMPECCABLE MEMORY 
tst2013.talkid1600_012 HE HAS A SELECTIVE ONE DAY 
tst2013.talkid1600_013 HE DOESN'T REMEMBER IF HE STOLE MY CHOCOLATE BAR BUT HE REMEMBERS THE GIVE RELIEF EVERY SO MY IPOD CONVERSATIONS WE HAD WHEN HE WAS FOUR WAY ON MY ARM OF THE FIRST EVER EPISODE OF TELETYPE IS A LADY GOGGLES BIRTHDAY 
tst2013.talkid1600_014 DON'T THEY FOUND INCREDIBLE 
tst2013.talkid1600_015 BUT MOST PEOPLE DON'T AGREE 
tst2013.talkid1600_016 AND IN FACT BECAUSE THEIR MINDS DON'T FEAR INTO SOCIETIES VERSION OF NORMAL THEY OFTEN BYPASSED A MISUNDERSTOOD 
tst2013.talkid1600_017 BUT WHAT LIFTED MY HEART AND STRENGTHENED MY SOUL WAS THAT EVEN THOUGH THIS WAS THE CASE ALTHOUGH THEY WERE NOT SEEN AS ORDINARY THIS COULD ONLY MEAN ONE THING THAT DAY WHERE EXTRAORDINARY AUTISTIC AND EXTRAORDINARY 
tst2013.talkid1600_018 NOW FOR YOU WHO MAYBE LESS FAMILIAR WITH THE TERM AUTISM IT'S A COMPLEX BRAIN DISORDER THAT AFFECTS SOCIAL COMMUNICATION LEARNING AND SOMETIMES PHYSICAL SKILLS 
tst2013.talkid1600_019 AND MANIFESTS IN EACH INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENTLY HENCE WHERE REHMI IS SO DIFFERENT FROM SAD 
tst2013.talkid1600_020 AND ACROSS THE WORLD EVERY TWENTY MINUTES ONE NEW PERSON IS DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM AND ALTHOUGH IT'S ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS IN THE WORLD THERE IS NO KNOWN CAUSE OR CURE 
tst2013.talkid1600_021 AND I CANNOT REMEMBER THE FIRST MOMENT I ENCOUNTERED AUTISM BUT I CANNOT RECALL A DAY WITHOUT IT 
tst2013.talkid1600_022 I WAS JUST THREE YEARS OLD WHEN MY BROTHER CAME ALONG AND I'VE SO EXCITED THAT I HAD TO NEW BEING IN MY LIFE 
tst2013.talkid1600_023 AND AFTER A FEW MONTHS WENT BY I REALIZED THAT HE WAS DIFFERENT 
tst2013.talkid1600_024 SHE SCREAMED A LOT 
tst2013.talkid1600_025 HE DIDN'T PLAY LIKE THE OTHER BABIES DID AND IN FACT HE DIDN'T SEEM VERY INTERESTED IN ME WHATSOEVER 
tst2013.talkid1600_026 WHEN WE LIVED A RAIN DID HIS OWN A WORLD WITH HIS OWN RULES AND HE FOUND PLEASURE IN THE SMALLEST THINGS LIKE LIGHTING UP CARS AROUND THE ROOM STARING AT THE WASHING MACHINE AND IT 'S AN ANYTHING THAT CAME IN BETWEEN 
tst2013.talkid1600_027 AND AS HE GREW OLDER HE GREW MORE DIFFERENT AND THE DIFFERENCES BECAME MORE OBVIOUS 
tst2013.talkid1600_028 YET BEYOND THE TANTRUMS AND THE FRUSTRATION AND NEVER ENDING HYPERACTIVITY WAS SOMETHING REALLY UNIQUE A PURE AND INNOCENT NATURE A BOY WHO SAW THE WORLD WITHOUT PREJUDICE A HUMAN WHO HAD NEVER LIED 
tst2013.talkid1600_029 EXTRAORDINARY 
tst2013.talkid1600_030 NOW I CANNOT DENY THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CHALLENGING MOMENTS IN MY FAMILY MOMENTS WHERE I'VE WISHED THAT THEY WERE JUST LIKE ME 
tst2013.talkid1600_031 BY COST MY MIND BACK TO THE THINGS THAT THEY'VE TAUGHT ME ABOUT INDIVIDUALITY AND COMMUNICATION AND LOVE AND I REALIZE THAT THESE ARE THINGS THAT I WOULDN'T WANT TO CHANGE WITH NORMALITY 
tst2013.talkid1600_032 NORMALITY OVERLOOKS THE BEAUTY THAT DIFFERENCES GIVE US AND THE FACT THAT WE A DIFFERENT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ONE OF US IS WRONG 
tst2013.talkid1600_033 IT JUST MEANS THAT THERE 'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF RIGHT 
tst2013.talkid1600_034 AND IF I COULD COMMUNICATE JUST ONE THING TO REHMI AND HIS SON AND TO YOU IT WOULD BE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE NORMAL 
tst2013.talkid1600_035 YOU CAN BE EXTRAORDINARY 
tst2013.talkid1600_036 BECAUSE AUTISTIC OR NOT THE DIFFERENCES THAT WE HAVE WE'VE GOT GIFT EVERYONE 'S GOT A GIFT INSIDE OF US AND IN ALL HONESTY THE PURSUIT OF NORMALITY IS THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE POTENTIAL 
tst2013.talkid1600_037 THE CHANCE FOR GREATNESS FOR PROGRESS AND FOR CHANGE DIES THE MOMENT WE TRY TO BE LIKE SOMEONE ELSE 
tst2013.talkid1600_038 PLEASE DON'T TELL ME I'M NORMAL 
tst2013.talkid1600_039 THANK YOU 
tst2013.talkid1610_000 I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT A VERY SPECIAL GROUP OF ANIMALS 
tst2013.talkid1610_001 THERE ARE TEN THOUSAND SPECIES OF BIRDS IN THE WORLD 
tst2013.talkid1610_002 VULTURES ARE AMONG THE MOST THREATEN GROUP OF BIRD 
tst2013.talkid1610_003 WHEN YOU SEE A VULTURE LIKE THIS THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO YOUR MIND IS THESE ARE DISGUSTING UGLY GREEDY CREATURES THAT ARE JUST AFTER YOUR FLESH ASSOCIATED WITH POLITICIANS 
tst2013.talkid1610_004 I WANT TO CHANGE THAT PERCEPTION I WANT TO CHANGE THOSE FEELINGS YOU HAVE FOR THESE BIRDS BECAUSE THEY NEED OUR SYMPATHY THEY REALLY DO 
tst2013.talkid1610_005 AND I'LL TELL YOU ARE 
tst2013.talkid1610_006 FIRST OF ALL WHY DO THEY HAVE SUCH A BAD PRESS 
tst2013.talkid1610_007 WHEN CHARLES DARWIN WENT ACROSS THE ATLANTIC AND EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO ON THE BEAGLE HE SAW THE TURKEY VULTURE AND HE SAID THESE ARE DISGUSTING BIRDS WITH BALD SCARLET HEADS THAT REFORM TO REVEL IN PUTRIDITY 
tst2013.talkid1610_008 YOU COULD NOT GET A WORSE INSULT AND THAT FROM CHARLES DARWIN 
tst2013.talkid1610_009 YOU KNOW HE CHANGED HIS MIND WHEN HE CAME BACK I 'LL TELL YOU ARE 
tst2013.talkid1610_010 THEY'VE ALSO BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH DESIGNING PERSONIFIED IS GOOFY DUNG STUPID CHARACTERS 
tst2013.talkid1610_011 MORE RECENTLY IF YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THE KENYAN PRESS THESE SO THE ATTRIBUTES THAT THIS ASSOCIATED THE KENYAN MPS WITH BUT I WANT TO CHALLENGE THAT 
tst2013.talkid1610_012 I WANT TO CHALLENGE THAT DO YOU KNOW WHY 
tst2013.talkid1610_013 BECAUSE MPS DO NOT KEEP THE ENVIRONMENT CLEAN 
tst2013.talkid1610_014 AND THESE DIDN'T HELP TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF DISEASES 
tst2013.talkid1610_015 THERE ARE HARDLY MONOGAMOUS 
tst2013.talkid1610_016 THEREFORE OFFER BEING EXTINCT 
tst2013.talkid1610_017 AND MY FAVORITE IS VULTURES A BETTER LOOKING 
tst2013.talkid1610_018 THERE 'S TWO TYPES OF VULTURES IN THIS PLANET 
tst2013.talkid1610_019 THERE ARE THE NEW WORLD VULTURES THAT ARE MAINLY FOUND IN THE AMERICAS LIKE THE CONDOS ON THE CARRIERS AND THEN THE OLD WORLD VULTURES WHERE WE HAVE SIXTEEN SPECIES FROM THESE SIXTEEN ELEVEN OF THEM ARE FACING A HIGH RISK OF EXTINCTION 
tst2013.talkid1610_020 SO WHY ARE VULTURES IMPORTANT FIRST OF ALL THEY PROVIDE VITAL ECOLOGICAL SERVICES THEY CLEAN UP 
tst2013.talkid1610_021 THERE ARE NATURAL GARBAGE COLLECTORS 
tst2013.talkid1610_022 THEY CLEAN UP CARCASSES RIGHT TO THE BONE 
tst2013.talkid1610_023 THEY HELP TO KILL ALL THE BACTERIA THEY HELP ABSORB ANTHRAX THAT WOULD OTHERWISE SPREAD AND CAUSE HUGE LIVESTOCK LOSSES AND DISEASES IN OTHER ANIMALS 
tst2013.talkid1610_024 RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT IN AREAS WHERE THERE ARE NO VULTURES CARCASSES TAKE UP TO THREE TO FOUR TIMES TO DECOMPOSE AND THIS HAS HUGE RAMIFICATIONS FOR THE SPREAD OF DISEASES 
tst2013.talkid1610_025 VULTURES ALSO HAVE TREMENDOUS HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE 
tst2013.talkid1610_026 THEY HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED IN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN CULTURE 
tst2013.talkid1610_027 NEKHBET WAS THE SYMBOL OF THE PROTECTOR AND THE MOTHERHOOD AND TOGETHER WITH THE COBRA SYMBOLIZED THE UNITY BETWEEN UPPER AND LOWER EGYPT 
tst2013.talkid1610_028 IN HINDU MYTHOLOGY JATAYU WAS THE VULTURE GOD AND HE RISKED HIS LIFE IN ORDER TO SAVE THE GODDESS SITA FROM THE TEN HEADED DEMON RAVANA 
tst2013.talkid1610_029 IN TIBETAN CULTURE THEY ARE PERFORMING VERY IMPORTANT SKY BURIALS IN PLACES LIKE TIBET THERE NO PLACES TO BURY THE DEAD OR WOOD TO CREMATE THEM SO THESE VULTURES PROVIDE A NATURAL DISPOSAL SYSTEM 
tst2013.talkid1610_030 SO WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH VULTURES 
tst2013.talkid1610_031 WE HAVE EIGHT SPECIES OF VULTURES THAT OCCUR IN KENYA OF WHICH SIX ARE HIGHLY THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION 
tst2013.talkid1610_032 THE REASON IS THAT THEY'RE GETTING POISONED AND THE REASON THAT THEY'RE GETTING POISONED IS BECAUSE THERE 'S HUMAN WILDLIFE CONFLICTS THE PASTORAL COMMUNITIES ARE USING THIS POISON TO TARGET PREDATORS AND IN RETURN THE VULTURES ARE FALLING VICTIM TO THIS 
tst2013.talkid1610_033 IN SOUTH ASIA IN COUNTRIES LIKE INDIA AND PAKISTAN FOUR SPECIES OF VULTURES ARE LISTED AS CRITICALLY ENDANGERED WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE LESS THAN TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS TO GO EXTINCT AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE THEY ARE FALLING PREY BY CONSUMING LIVESTOCK THAT HAS BEEN TREATED WITH A PAINKILLING DRUG LIKE DICLOFENAC 
tst2013.talkid1610_034 THIS DRUG HAS NOW BEEN BANNED FOR VETERINARY USE IN INDIA AND THEY HAVE TAKEN A STAND 
tst2013.talkid1610_035 BECAUSE THERE ARE NO VULTURES THERE 'S BEEN A SPREAD IN THE NUMBERS OF FERAL DOGS AT CARCASS DUMP SITES AND WHEN YOU HAVE FERAL DOGS YOU HAVE A HUGE TIME BOMB OF RABIES THE NUMBER OF CASES OF RABIES HAS INCREASED TREMENDOUSLY IN INDIA 
tst2013.talkid1610_036 KENYA IS GOING TO HAVE ONE OF THE LARGEST WIND FARMS IN AFRICA THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY THREE WIND TURBINES ARE GOING TO BE UP AT LAKE TURKANA 
tst2013.talkid1610_037 I'M NOT AGAINST WIND ENERGY BUT WE NEED TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNMENTS BECAUSE WIND TURBINES DO THIS TO BIRDS THEY SLICE THEM IN HALF 
tst2013.talkid1610_038 THERE ARE BIRD BLENDING MACHINES 
tst2013.talkid1610_039 IN WEST AFRICA THERE'S A HORRIFIC TRADE OF DEAD VULTURES TO SERVE THE WITCHCRAFT AND THE FETISH MARKET 
tst2013.talkid1610_040 SO WHAT'S BEING DONE WHERE WE CONDUCTING RESEARCH ON THESE BIRDS WE'RE PUTTING TRANSMITTERS ON THEM 
tst2013.talkid1610_041 WE'RE TRYING TO DETERMINE THEIR BASIC ECOLOGY AND SEE WHERE THEY GO 
tst2013.talkid1610_042 WE CAN SEE THAT THEY TRAVEL DIFFERENT COUNTRIES SO IF YOU FOCUS ON A PROBLEM LOCALLY IT 'S NOT GOING TO HELP YOU 
tst2013.talkid1610_043 WE NEED TO WORK WITH GOVERNMENTS IN REGIONAL LEVELS 
tst2013.talkid1610_044 WE'RE WORKING WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES 
tst2013.talkid1610_045 WE 'RE TALKING TO THEM ABOUT APPRECIATING VULTURES ABOUT THE NEED FROM WITHIN TO APPRECIATE THESE WONDERFUL CREATURES AND THE SERVICES THAT THEY PROVIDE 
tst2013.talkid1610_046 HOW CAN YOU HELP YOU CAN BECOME ACTIVE MAKE NOISE YOU CAN WRITE A LETTER YOUR GOVERNMENT AND TELL THEM THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THIS VERY MISUNDERSTOOD CREATURES VOLUNTEER TIME TO SPREAD THE WORD SPREAD THE WORD 
tst2013.talkid1610_047 WHEN YOU WALK OUT OF THIS ROOM YOU WILL BE INFORMED ABOUT VULTURES BUT SPEAKING OF FAMILIES TO YOUR CHILDREN TO YOUR NEIGHBORS ABOUT VULTURES 
tst2013.talkid1610_048 THEY ARE VERY GRACEFUL CHARLES DARWIN SAID THE CHANGES MIND BECAUSE HE WATCHED THEM FLY EFFORTLESSLY WITHOUT ENERGY IN THE SKIES 
tst2013.talkid1610_049 KENYA THIS WORLD WILL BE MUCH POORER WITHOUT THESE WONDERFUL SPECIES 
tst2013.talkid1610_050 THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
tst2013.talkid1617_000 EVERYTHING I DO AND EVERYTHING I DO PROFESSIONALLY MY LIFE HAS BEEN SHAPED BY SEVEN YEARS OF WORK AS A YOUNG MAN IN AFRICA 
tst2013.talkid1617_001 FROM NINETY SEVENTY ONE TO NINETY SEVENTY SEVEN YOUNG BUT I'M NOT I WORKED IN ZAMBIA KENYA I'VE BECAUSE MEDIA SOMALIA IN PROJECTS OF TECHNICAL COOPERATION WITH AFRICAN COUNTRIES

tst2013.talkid1617_008 AND OF COURSE THE LOCAL PEOPLE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST IN DOING THAT SO WE PAY THEM TO COME AND WORK AND SOMETIMES THEY WOULD SHOW UP 
tst2013.talkid1617_009 AND WE WERE AMAZED THAT THE LOCAL PEOPLE IN SUCH FERTILE BOLLYWOOD NOT HAVE ANY AGRICULTURE 
tst2013.talkid1617_010 AND INSTEAD OF ASKING THEM HOW COME THEY WERE NOT GROWING ANYTHING WE SIMPLY SAID THING GOD WE HEAR 
tst2013.talkid1617_011 JUST IN THE NICKEL TIME TO SAVE THE ZAMBIAN PEOPLE FROM STARVATION 
tst2013.talkid1617_012 AND OF COURSE EVERYTHING IN AFRICA GREW BEAUTIFULLY 
tst2013.talkid1617_013 WE HAD THIS MAGNIFICENT MOTHERS IN ITALY AT A MOTHER WILL GROW TO BE SIZE IN ZAMBIA TO THIS SIZE 
tst2013.talkid1617_014 AND WE COULD NOT BELIEVE AND WE WERE TELLING THE TIME THAT'S LOOK HOW EASY AGRICULTURE IS

tst2013.talkid1617_016 AND WE SAID TO THAT 'S AMBIENT LIKE ALL THEY HATE FOOD 
tst2013.talkid1617_017 AND IT 'S UNDER SAID YES THAT'S WHY WE HAVE NO AGRICULTURE HERE 
tst2013.talkid1617_018 WHY DIDN'T YOU TASKS YOU NEVER 
tst2013.talkid1617_019 I THOUGHT THAT WAS ONLY ASSAY TALENTS BLUNDERING AROUND AFRICA BUT THEN I SAW WOULD THE AMERICANS WITH DOING WHAT THEY ENGLISH WE'RE DOING WHAT THE FRENCH WITH DOING AND AFTER SEEING WHAT THEY WERE DOING I BECAME QUITE PROUD OF A PROJECT IN ZAMBIA 
tst2013.talkid1617_020 BECAUSE YOU SEE AT LEAST WE FED HE POSE 
tst2013.talkid1617_021 YOU SHOULD SEE THAT YOU SHOULD SEE THEIR RUBBISH THAT WE HAVE BESTOWED ON SUSPECTING AFRICAN PEOPLE

tst2013.talkid1617_023 THE BOOK WAS PUBLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE

tst2013.talkid1617_029 THE TWO WORDS COME FROM THE LATIN ROOT PARTER WHICH MEANS FATHER 
tst2013.talkid1617_030 BUT THEY MEAN TWO DIFFERENT THINGS 
tst2013.talkid1617_031 BUT THERE ARE LISTED I TRIP ANYBODY FROM A DIFFERENT CULTURE US IF THEY WERE MY CHILDREN ARE LOVE YOU SO MUCH 
tst2013.talkid1617_032 BUT ORGANIZING EVERYBODY FROM ANOTHER CULTURE THEY WHERE MY SERVANT 
tst2013.talkid1617_033 THAT 'S WHY THEY'RE WHITE PEOPLE IN AFRICA ARE CALLED ONE BOSS 
tst2013.talkid1617_034 I WAS GIVEN A SLAP IN THE FACE READING A BOOK SMALL IS BEAUTIFUL WRITTEN BY SCHUMACHER WHO SAID ABOVE ALL IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IF PEOPLE DO NOT WISH TO BE HELPED LIVED ALONE 
tst2013.talkid1617_035 THIS SHOULD BE THE FIRST PRINCIPLE OF AID 
tst2013.talkid1617_036 THE FIRST PRINCIPLE OF AID IS RESPECT 
tst2013.talkid1617_037 THIS MORNING THE GENTLEMAN WHO OPENED THIS CONFERENCE LAY A STICK ON THE FLOOR AND SAID CAN WE CAN YOU IMAGINE A CITY THAT IS NOT NEOCOLONIAL 
tst2013.talkid1617_038 I DECIDED WHEN I WAS TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OLD TO ONLY RESPOND TO PEOPLE AND I INVENTED A SYSTEM CALLED ENTERPRISE FACILITATION WHERE YOU NEVER INITIATE ANYTHING YOU NEVER MOTIVATE ANYBODY BY YOU BECOME A SERVANT OF THE LOCAL PASSION THE SERVANT OF LOCAL PEOPLE WHO HAVE A DREAM TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON 
tst2013.talkid1617_039 SO WHAT YOU DO YOU SHUT UP 
tst2013.talkid1617_040 YOU NEVER ARRIVE IN A COMMUNITY WITH ANY IDEAS AND YOU SIT WITH THE LOCAL PEOPLE 
tst2013.talkid1617_041 WE DON'T WORK FROM OFFICES 
tst2013.talkid1617_042 WE MEET AT THE CAFE WE MEET AT THE PUB 
tst2013.talkid1617_043 WE HAVE ZERO INFRASTRUCTURE 
tst2013.talkid1617_044 AND WHAT WE DO WE BECOME FRIENDS AND WE FIND OUT WHAT THAT PERSON WANTS TO DO 
tst2013.talkid1617_045 THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS PASSION 
tst2013.talkid1617_046 YOU CAN GIVE SOMEBODY AN IDEA 
tst2013.talkid1617_047 IF THAT PERSON DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO 
tst2013.talkid1617_048 THE PASSION THAT THE PERSON HAIRS FOR HAIR OWN GROWTH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING 
tst2013.talkid1617_049 THE PASSION THAT THAN MEN HAZE FOR IS OWNED PERSONAL GROWTH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING 
tst2013.talkid1617_050 AND THEN WE HELP THEM TO GO AND FIND THE KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE NOBODY IN THE WORLD CAN SUCCEED IN LOAN 
tst2013.talkid1617_051 THE PERSON WITH THE IDEA MAY NOT HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE BUT THE KNOWLEDGE IS AVAILABLE 
tst2013.talkid1617_052 SO YEARS AND YEARS AGO I HAD THIS IDEA WHY DON'T WE FOR ONCE INSTEAD OF ARRIVING IN A COMMUNITY TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT TO DO WHY DON'T FOR ONCE LISTEN TO THEM BUT NOT IN COMMUNITY MEETINGS 
tst2013.talkid1617_053 LET ME TELL YOU A SECRET 
tst2013.talkid1617_054 THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH COMMUNITY MEETINGS 
tst2013.talkid1617_055 AND KIRCHNERS NEVER COME AND THEY NEVER TELL YOU IN A PUBLIC MEETING WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH THEIR OWN MONEY WHAT OPPORTUNITY THEY HAVE IDENTIFIED 
tst2013.talkid1617_056 SO PLANNING HAS THIS BLIND SPOT 
tst2013.talkid1617_057 THE SMARTEST PEOPLE IN YOUR COMMUNITY YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW LONG BECAUSE THEY DON'T COME TO YOUR PUBLIC MEETINGS 
tst2013.talkid1617_058 WHAT WE DO WE WORK ONE ON ONE AND TO WORK ONE ON ONE YEAR TO CREATE A SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT DOESN'T EXIST 
tst2013.talkid1617_059 YOU HAD TO CREATE A NEW PROFESSION 
tst2013.talkid1617_060 THE PROFESSION IS THEY FAMILY DOCTOR OF ENTERPRISE THE FAMILY DOCTOR BUSINESS WHO SITS WE DO YOU IN YOUR HOUSE YOUR KITCHEN TABLE AT THE CAFE AND HELPS YOU FIND THE RESOURCES TO TRANSFORM YOUR PASSION INTO A WAY TO MAKE A LIVING 
tst2013.talkid1617_061 I STARTED THIS AS IT TRYOUT IN ESPERANCE IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA 
tst2013.talkid1617_062 I WAS DOING A PH D AT THE TIME TRYING TO GO AWAY WAY FROM THIS PATTERN NIZING BULLSHIT THAT WE ARRIVE AND TELL YOU WHAT TO DO 
tst2013.talkid1617_063 AND SO WHAT I DID IN ESPERANCE THE FIRST YEAR WAS TO JUST WALK THE STREETS AND IN THE IN THREE DAYS I HAD MY FIRST CLIENT THEY HELP HIS FIRST GUY WHO WAS SMOKING FISH FROM MY GARAGE WAS A MAORI GUY AND I HELPED HIM TO SELL TO THE RESTAURANT IN PERTH TO GET ORGANIZED AND THEN THE FISHERMEN CAME TO ME TO SAY YOU THE GUY WHO HELPED MAORI CAN YOU HELP US 
tst2013.talkid1617_064 AND I HAVE THIS FIVE FISHERMEN TO WORK TOGETHER AND GET THIS BEAUTIFUL TUNA NOT TODAY CANNERY IN ALBANY FOR SIXTY CENTS A KILO BUT WE FIND A WAY TO TAKE THE FISH FOR SUSHI TO JAPAN FOR FIFTEEN DOLLARS A KILO AND THE FARMERS CAME TO TALK TO ME SAY HEY YOU HELP THEM CAN YOU HELP US 
tst2013.talkid1617_065 IN A YEAR I HAD TWENTY SEVEN PROJECTS GOING ON AND THE GOVERNMENT CAME TO SEE ME TO SAY HOW CAN YOU DO THAT 
tst2013.talkid1617_066 HOW CAN YOU AND I SAID I DO SOMETHING VERY VERY VERY DIFFICULT 
tst2013.talkid1617_067 I SHOT UP TO LISTEN TO THEM 
tst2013.talkid1617_068 SO THE GOVERNMENT SAYS DO THE GAME 
tst2013.talkid1617_069 WE'VE DONE IN THREE HUNDRED COMMUNITIES AROUND THE WORLD 
tst2013.talkid1617_070 WE HAVE TO START FORTY THOUSAND BUSINESSES 
tst2013.talkid1617_071 THERE 'S A NEW GENERATION OF ENTREPRENEURS WHO ARE DYING OF SOLITUDE 
tst2013.talkid1617_072 PETER DRUCKER ONE OF THE GREATEST MANAGEMENT CONSULTANTS IN HISTORY DIED H NINETY SIX FEW YEARS AGO 
tst2013.talkid1617_073 BECAUSE I WAS A PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY BEFORE BECOMING INVOLVED IN BUSINESS AND THIS IS WHAT THE DRUG ASSAYS PLANNING IS ACTUALLY INCOMPATIBLE WITHIN ENTREPRENEURIAL SOCIETY IN THE ECONOMY 
tst2013.talkid1617_074 PLANNING IS THE KISS OF DEATH OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP 
tst2013.talkid1617_075 SO NOW YOU'RE REBUILDING CHRIST CHURCH WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THE SMARTEST PEOPLE IN CHRISTCHURCH WANT TO DO WITH THEIR OWN MONEY AND THEIR OWN ENERGY 
tst2013.talkid1617_076 YOU HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO GET THESE PEOPLE TO COME AND TALK TO YOU 
tst2013.talkid1617_077 YOU HAVE TO OFFER THEM CONFIDENTIALITY PRIVACY YOU HAVE TO BE FANTASTIC AT HELPING THEM AND THEN THEY WILL COME AND THEY WILL COME IN DROVES 
tst2013.talkid1617_078 IN A COMMUNAL TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WE GET TWO HUNDRED CLIENTS 
tst2013.talkid1617_079 CAN IMAGINE A COMMUNITY OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE THEY INTELLIGENCE AND THE PASSION 
tst2013.talkid1617_080 WHICH PRESENTATION IF YOU APPLAUDED THE MOST THIS MORNING 
tst2013.talkid1617_081 LOCAL PASSIONATE PEOPLE THAT 'S WHO YOU HAVE UPLOAD IT 
tst2013.talkid1617_082 SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS WHERE THE SITE 
tst2013.talkid1617_083 WE ARE THE END OR THE FIRST INDUSTRY REVOLUTION KNOWN RENEWABLES FOSSIL FUELS MANUFACTURING AND ALL OF THE SUDDEN WE HAVE SYSTEM WHICH ARE NOT SUSTAINABLE 
tst2013.talkid1617_084 THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE IS NOT SUSTAINABLE 
tst2013.talkid1617_085 FREON WHALE A MONTAGNE THINKS IT'S NOT SUSTAINABLE 
tst2013.talkid1617_086 WHAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IS UP HOW WE FEED CURE EDUCATE TRANSPORT COMMUNICATE FOR SEVEN BILLION PEOPLE IN A SUSTAINABLE WAY 
tst2013.talkid1617_087 THE TECHNOLOGIES DO NOT EXIST TO DO THAT 
tst2013.talkid1617_088 WHO IS GOING TO INVENT THE TECHNOLOGY FOR THE GREEN REVOLUTION YOU DIVERSITY IS FORGET ABOUT IT 
tst2013.talkid1617_089 GOVERNMENT FORGET ABOUT IT 
tst2013.talkid1617_090 WOULD BE ENTREPRENEURS AND THEY'RE DOING IT NOW 
tst2013.talkid1617_091 THERE 'S A LOVELY STORY THAT I READ IN A FUTURIST MAGAZINE MANY MANY YEARS AGO 
tst2013.talkid1617_092 IT WAS A GROUP OF EXPERTS WHO WERE INVITED TO DISCUSS THE FUTURE OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY 
tst2013.talkid1617_093 AND IN EIGHTEEN SIXTIES GROUP OF PEOPLE CAME TOGETHER AND THEY ALL SPECULATED ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE CITY OF NEW YORK IN ONE HUNDRED YEARS AND THE CONCLUSION WAS UNANIMOUS THE CITY OF NEW YORK WOULD NOT EXIST IN ONE HUNDRED YEARS 
tst2013.talkid1617_094 WHY BECAUSE THEY LOOK AT THE CURVE IF THE POPULATION KEEPS GROWING AT THIS RATE TO MOVE THE POPULATION OF NEW YORK AROUND THEY WOULD HAVE NEEDED SIX MILLION HORSES IN THEM MY NEW CREATED BY SIX MILLION ALSO WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DEAL 
tst2013.talkid1617_095 THERE WAS ALREADY THE RONNING IN MANURE 
tst2013.talkid1617_096 SO EIGHTEEN SIXTY THEY ARE SEE THIS DIRTY TECHNOLOGY THAT IS GOING TO CHOKE THE LIFE OUT OF NEW YORK 
tst2013.talkid1617_097 SO WHAT HAPPENS IN FORTY YEARS TIME E AND NINETEEN HUNDRED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THERE WERE ONE THOUSAND AND ONE CAR MANUFACTURING COMPANIES ONE THOUSAND ONE 
tst2013.talkid1617_098 THE THE IDEA OF A FUNNY DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY AND ABSOLUTELY TAKEN OVER AND THEY 'RE TINY TINY LITTLE FACTORIES IN BACKWATERS 
tst2013.talkid1617_099 DEARBORN MICHIGAN HENRY FORD 
tst2013.talkid1617_100 HOWEVER THERE IS A SECRET TO WORK WITH ENTREPRENEURS 
tst2013.talkid1617_101 FIRST YOU HAVE TO OFFER THEM CONFIDENTIALITY 
tst2013.talkid1617_102 OTHERWISE THEY DON'T COME AND TALK TO YOU 
tst2013.talkid1617_103 THEN YOU HAVE TO TALK OFFER THEM ABSOLUTE DEDICATED PASSIONATE SERVICE TO THEM 
tst2013.talkid1617_104 AND THEN YOU TELL THEM THE TRUTH ABOUT ENTREPRENEURSHIP 
tst2013.talkid1617_105 THE SMALLEST COMPANY THE BIGGEST COMPANY HAS TO BE CAPABLE DOING THREE THINGS BEAUTIFULLY THE PRODUCT THEY YOU WANT TO SELL HAS TO BE FANTASTIC YOU HAVE TO HAVE FANTASTIC MARKETING AND YOU HAVE HAVE TREMENDOUS FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 
tst2013.talkid1617_106 GUESS WHAT 
tst2013.talkid1617_107 WE HAVE NEVER MET A SINGLE HUMAN BEING IN THE WORLD WHO CAN MAKE IT SELL IT TO LOOK AFTER THE MONEY 
tst2013.talkid1617_108 DOESN'T EXIST 
tst2013.talkid1617_109 THIS PERSON HAS NEVER BEEN BORN 
tst2013.talkid1617_110 WE'VE DONE THE RESEARCH AND WE HAVE LOOKED AT THE ONE HUNDRED ICONIC COMPANIES OF THE WORLD CARNEGIE WESTINGHOUSE EDISON FORD ALL THE NEW COMPANIES GOOGLE YAHOO 
tst2013.talkid1617_111 THERE 'S ONLY ONE THING THAT ALL THIS SUCCESSFUL COMPANY IN THE WORLD HAVE IN COMMON ONLY ONE NONE WAS STARTED BY ONE PERSON 
tst2013.talkid1617_112 NOW WE TEACH ENTREPRENEURSHIP TO SIXTEEN YEARS OLD IN NORTHUMBERLAND AND WE START THE CLASS BY GIVING THEM THE FIRST TWO PAGES OF RICHARD BRANSON AUTOBIOGRAPHY AND THE TASK OF THE SIXTEEN YEARS OLD IS IT TO UNDERLINE IN THE FIRST TWO PAGES OF RICHARD BRANSON AUTOBIOGRAPHY HOW MANY TIMES RICHARD USES THE WORD WHY AND HOW MANY TIME USE OF THE WORD WE 
tst2013.talkid1617_113 NEVER THE WORLD I AND THE WORD WE THIRTY TWO TIMES 
tst2013.talkid1617_114 HE WASN'T ALONE WHEN HE STARTED 
tst2013.talkid1617_115 NOBODY STARTED A COMPANY ALONE NO ONE 
tst2013.talkid1617_116 SO WE CAN CREATE A COMMUNITY WHERE WE HAVE FACILITATORS WHO COME FROM A SMALL BUSINESS BACKGROUND SITTING IN CAFES IN BARS AND YOUR DEDICATED BUDDIES WHO WILL GO TO YOU WHAT SOMEBODY DID FOR THIS GENTLEMAN WHO TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW THIS EPIC SOMEBODY WHO WILL SAY TO YOU WHAT DO YOU NEED 
tst2013.talkid1617_117 WHAT CAN YOU DO WHEN YOU MAKE IT 
tst2013.talkid1617_118 OK CAN YOU SELL IT CAN YOU LOOK AFTER THE MONEY 
tst2013.talkid1617_119 I CANNOT DO THESE WE LIKE ME TO FIND YOU SOMEBODY 
tst2013.talkid1617_120 WE ACTIVATE COMMUNITIES 
tst2013.talkid1617_121 WE HAVE GROUPS OF VOLUNTEERS SUPPORTING THE ENTERPRISE FACILITATOR TO HELP YOU TO FIND RESOURCES AND PEOPLE AND WE HAVE DISCOVERED THAT THE MIRACLE OF THE INTELLIGENCE OF LOCAL PEOPLE SUCH THAT YOU CAN CHANGE THE CULTURE AND THE ECONOMY OF THIS COMMUNITY JUST BY CAPTURING THE PASSION THE ENERGY IN IMAGINATION OF YOUR OWN PEOPLE 
tst2013.talkid1617_122 THANK YOU 
tst2013.talkid1634_000 HUNDRED YEARS BEEN MY PASSION EVER SINCE I WAS OLD ENOUGH TO PICK UP A CAMERA BUT TODAY I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THE FIFTEEN MOST TREASURED PHOTOS OF MINE AND I DIDN'T TAKE ANY OF THEM 
tst2013.talkid1634_001 THERE WERE NO ART DIRECTORS NO STYLISTS NO CHANCE FOR RESHOOTS NOT EVEN ANY REGARD FOR LIGHTING 
tst2013.talkid1634_002 IN FACT MOST OF THEM WERE TAKEN BY RANDOM TOURISTS 
tst2013.talkid1634_003 MY STORY BEGINS WHEN I WAS IN NEW YORK CITY FOR A SPEAKING ENGAGEMENT AND MY WIFE TOOK THIS PICTURE OF ME HOLDING MY DAUGHTER ON OUR FIRST BIRTHDAY WE'RE ON THE CORNER FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND FIFTH 
tst2013.talkid1634_004 WE HAPPEN TO BE BACK IN NEW YORK EXACTLY A YEAR LATER SO WE DECIDED TO TAKE THE SAME PICTURE 
tst2013.talkid1634_005 WHERE YOU CAN SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING 
tst2013.talkid1634_006 APPROACHING MY DAUGHTERS THIRD BIRTHDAY MY WIFE SAID HEY ONE YOU TAKE SABENA BACK TO NEW YORK AND MAKE IT A FATHER DAUGHTER TRIP AND CONTINUE THE RITUAL 
tst2013.talkid1634_007 THIS IS WHEN WE STARTED ASKING PASSING TOURISTS TO TAKE THE PICTURE 
tst2013.talkid1634_008 YOU KNOW IT'S REMARKABLE HOW UNIVERSAL THE GESTURE IS OF HANDING YOUR CAMERA TO A TOTAL STRANGER 
tst2013.talkid1634_009 NO ONE 'S EVER REFUSED UNLIKELY NO ONE 'S EVER RUN OFF WITH OUR CAMERA 
tst2013.talkid1634_010 BACK THEN WE HAD NO IDEA HOW MUCH THIS TRIP IT CHANGED OUR LIVES 
tst2013.talkid1634_011 IT 'S REALLY BECOME SACRED TO US 
tst2013.talkid1634_012 THIS ONE WAS TAKEN JUST WEEKS AFTER NINE ELEVEN AND I FOUND MYSELF TRYING TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY IN WAYS A FIVE YEAR OLD COULD UNDERSTAND 
tst2013.talkid1634_013 SO THESE PHOTOS ARE FAR MORE THAN PROXIES FOR A SINGLE MOMENT OR EVEN A SPECIFIC TRIP 
tst2013.talkid1634_014 THERE ARE ALSO WAYS FOR US TO FREEZE TIME FOR ONE WE CAN OCTOBER AND REFLECT ON OUR TIMES AND HOW WE CHANGED FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND NOT JUST PHYSICALLY BUT IN EVERY WAY 
tst2013.talkid1634_015 BECAUSE WHILE WE TAKE THE SAME PHOTO OUR PERSPECTIVES CHANGE AND SHE REACHES NEW MILESTONES AND I GET TO SEE LIFE THROUGH HER EYES AND HOW SHE INTERACTS WITH AND SEES EVERYTHING 
tst2013.talkid1634_016 THIS VERY FOCUSED TIME WE GET TO SPEND TOGETHER IS SOMETHING WE CHERISH AND ANTICIPATE THE ENTIRE YEAR 
tst2013.talkid1634_017 RECENTLY ON ONE TRIP WHERE WALKING AND SHE STOPS DEAD IN HER TRACKS AND SHE POINTS TO A RED AWNING OF THE DOLL STORE THAT SHE LOVED WHEN SHE WAS LITTLE ON OUR EARLIER TRIPS 
tst2013.talkid1634_018 AND SHE DESCRIBES TO ME THE FEELING SHE FELT AS A FIVE YEAR OLD STANDING IN THAT EXACT SPOT 
tst2013.talkid1634_019 SHE SAID SHE REMEMBERS HER HEART BURSTING OUT OF HER CHEST WHEN SHE SAW THAT PLACE FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME NINE YEARS EARLIER 
tst2013.talkid1634_020 AND NOW WHAT SHE'S LOOKING AT IN NEW YORK OR COLLEGES BECAUSE SHE'S DETERMINED TO GO TO SCHOOL IN NEW YORK 
tst2013.talkid1634_021 AND IT HIT ME ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE ALL MAKE OUR MEMORIES 
tst2013.talkid1634_022 SO I WANT TO SHARE THE IDEA OF TAKING AN ACTIVE ROLE IN CONSCIOUSLY CREATING MEMORIES 
tst2013.talkid1634_023 I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT ASIDE FROM THESE FIFTEEN SHOTS I'M NOT MANY OF THE FAMILY PHOTOS 
tst2013.talkid1634_024 I'M ALWAYS THE ONE TAKING THE PICTURE 
tst2013.talkid1634_025 SO I WANT TO ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TODAY TO GET IN THE SHOT AND DON'T HESITATE TO GO UP TO SOMEONE AND ASK WE TAKE OUR PICTURE 
tst2013.talkid1634_026 THANK YOU 
tst2013.talkid1637_000 ONE DAY IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THREE THOUSAND MILES OFF THE COAST OF CHILE AND ONE OF THE MOST REMOTE REGIONS OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN TWENTY AMERICAN SAILORS WATCHED THEIR SHIP FLOOD WITH SEAWATER 
tst2013.talkid1637_001 THEY'VE BEEN STRUCK BY A SPERM WHALES WHICH HAD REACHED A CATASTROPHIC HOLE IN THE SHIP SOLVE 
tst2013.talkid1637_002 AS THEIR SHIP BEGAN TO SINK BENEATH THE SWELLS THE MEN HUDDLED TOGETHER IN THREE SMALL WHALEBOATS 
tst2013.talkid1637_003 THESE MEN WERE TEN THOUSAND MILES FROM HOME MORE THAN A THOUSAND MILES FROM THE NEAREST SCRAP OF LAND 
tst2013.talkid1637_004 IN THEIR SMALL BOATS THEY CARRIED ONLY RUDIMENTARY NAVIGATIONAL EQUIPMENT AND LIMITED SUPPLIES OF FOOD AND WATER 
tst2013.talkid1637_005 THESE WERE THE MEN OF THE WHALESHIP ESSEX WHOSE STORY WOULD LATER INSPIRE PARTS OF MOBY DICK 
tst2013.talkid1637_006 EVEN IN TODAY 'S WORLD THEIR SITUATION WOULD BE REALLY DIRE BUT THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH WORSE IT AND THEN 
tst2013.talkid1637_007 NO ON LAND HAD ANY IDEA THAT ANYTHING HAD GONE WRONG 
tst2013.talkid1637_008 NO SEARCH PARTY WAS COMING TO LOOK FOR THESE MEN 
tst2013.talkid1637_009 SO MOST OF US HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED THIS SITUATION AS FRIGHTENING AS THE ONE IN WHICH THESE SAILORS FOUND THEMSELVES BUT WE ALL KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE AFRAID 
tst2013.talkid1637_010 WE KNOW HOW FEAR FEELS BUT I'M NOT SURE WE SPEND ENOUGH TIME THINKING ABOUT WHAT OUR FEARS MEAN 
tst2013.talkid1637_011 AS WE GROW UP WERE OFTEN ENCOURAGED TO THINK OF FEAR AS A WEAKNESS JUST ANOTHER CHILDISH THING TO DISCARD LIKE BABY TEETH OR ROLLER SKATES 
tst2013.talkid1637_012 AND I THINK IT 'S NO ACCIDENT THAT WE THINK THIS WAY 
tst2013.talkid1637_013 NEUROSCIENTISTS HAVE ACTUALLY SHOWN THAT HUMAN BEINGS ARE HARDWIRED TO BE OPTIMISTS 
tst2013.talkid1637_014 SO MAYBE THAT 'S WHY WE THINK OF FEAR SOMETIMES AS A DANGER IN AND OF ITSELF 
tst2013.talkid1637_015 DON'T WORRY WE LIKE TO SAY TO ONE ANOTHER DON'T PANIC 
tst2013.talkid1637_016 IN ENGLISH FEAR IS SOMETHING WE CONQUER 
tst2013.talkid1637_017 IT 'S SOMETHING WE FIGHT SOMETHING WE OVERCOME 
tst2013.talkid1637_018 BUT WHAT IF WE LOOKED AT FEAR IN A FRESH WAY 
tst2013.talkid1637_019 WHAT IF WE THOUGHT OF FEAR AS AN AMAZING ACTIVE IMAGINATION SOMETHING THAT CAN BE AS PROFOUND AND INSIGHTFUL I STORYTELLING ITSELF 
tst2013.talkid1637_020 IT 'S EASIEST TO SEE THIS LINK BETWEEN FEAR AND IMAGINATION IN YOUNG CHILDREN WHOSE FEARS ARE OFTEN EXTRAORDINARILY VIVID 
tst2013.talkid1637_021 WHEN I WAS A CHILD I LIVED IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS YOU KNOW MOSTLY A VERY NICE PLACE TO LIVE BUT FOR ME AS A CHILD CALIFORNIA COULD ALSO BE A LITTLE SCARY 
tst2013.talkid1637_022 I REMEMBER HOW HOW FRIGHTENING I WAS TO SEE THE CHANDELIER THAT ONE OF OUR DINING TABLE SWING BACK AND FORTH DURING EVERY MINOR EARTHQUAKE AND I SOMETIMES COULDN'T SLEEP AT NIGHT TERRIFIED AT THE BIG ONE MIGHT STRIKE WHAT WE WERE SLEEPING 
tst2013.talkid1637_023 AND WHAT WE SAY ABOUT KIDS WHO HAVE FEARS LIKE THAT IS THAT THEY HAVE A VIVID IMAGINATION 
tst2013.talkid1637_024 BUT AT A CERTAIN POINT MOST OF US LEARN TO LEAVE THESE KINDS OF VISIONS BEHIND AND GROW UP 
tst2013.talkid1637_025 AND WE LEARN THAT THERE ARE NO MONSTERS HIDING UNDER THE BED AND NOT EVERY EARTHQUAKE BRINGS BUILDINGS DOWN 
tst2013.talkid1637_026 BUT MAYBE IT 'S NO COINCIDENCE THAT SOME OF OUR MOST CREATIVE MINDS FAIL TO LEAVE THESE KINDS OF FEARS BEHIND AS ADULTS 
tst2013.talkid1637_027 THE SAME INCREDIBLE IMAGINATIONS THAT PRODUCED THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES JANE EYRE THE REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS PAST ALSO GENERATED INTENSE WORRIES THAT HAUNTED THE ADULT LIVES OF CHARLES DARWIN CHARLOTTE BRONTăť DAY AND MARCEL PROUST 
tst2013.talkid1637_028 SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT CAN THE REST OF US LEARN ABOUT FEAR FROM VISIONARIES AND YOUNG CHILDREN 
tst2013.talkid1637_029 LET 'S RETURN TO THE YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FOR A MOMENT TO THE SITUATION FACING THE CREW OF THE WHALESHIP ESSEX 
tst2013.talkid1637_030 LET 'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE FEARS THAT THEIR IMAGINATIONS WERE GENERATING AS THEY DRIFTED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PACIFIC 
tst2013.talkid1637_031 TWENTY FOUR HOURS HAVE NOW PASSED SINCE THE CAPSIZING OF THE SHIP 
tst2013.talkid1637_032 THE TIME HAD COME FOR THE MEN TO MAKE A PLAN BUT THEY HAD VERY FEW OPTIONS 
tst2013.talkid1637_033 IN HIS FASCINATING ACCOUNT OF THE DISASTER NATHANIEL PHILBRICK WROTE THAT THESE MEN WERE JUST ABOUT AS FAR FROM LAND AS IT WAS POSSIBLE TO BE ANYWHERE ON EARTH 
tst2013.talkid1637_034 THE MENU THAT THE NEAREST ISLANDS THEY COULD REACH WITHIN OUR CASE ISLANDS TWELVE HUNDRED MILES AWAY 
tst2013.talkid1637_035 BUT THEY HEARD SOME FRIGHTENING RUMORS 
tst2013.talkid1637_036 THEY'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THESE ISLANDS AND SEVERAL OTHERS NEARBY WERE POPULATED BY CANNIBALS 
tst2013.talkid1637_037 SO THE MEN PICTURED COMING ASHORE ONLY TO BE MURDERED AND EVEN FOR DINNER 
tst2013.talkid1637_038 ANOTHER POSSIBLE DESTINATION WAS HAWAII BUT GIVEN THE SEASON THE CAPTAIN WAS AFRAID BABY STRUCK BY SEVERE STORMS 
tst2013.talkid1637_039 NOW THE LAST OPTION WAS THE LONGEST AND THE MOST DIFFICULT TO SAIL FIFTEEN HUNDRED MILES DUE SOUTH IN HOPES OF REACHING A CERTAIN BAND OF WINDS THAT COULD EVENTUALLY PUSH THEM TOWARD THE COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA 
tst2013.talkid1637_040 BUT THEY KNEW THAT THE SHEER LENGTH OF THIS JOURNEY WOULD STRETCH THEIR SUPPLIES OF FOOD AND WATER 
tst2013.talkid1637_041 TO BE EATEN BY CANNIBALS TO BE BATTERED BY STORMS TO STARVE TO DEATH BEFORE REACHING LAND 
tst2013.talkid1637_042 THESE WERE THE FEARS THAT DANCED IN THE IMAGINATIONS OF THESE POOR MEN AND AS IT TURNED OUT THE FEAR THEY CHOSE TO LISTEN TO WOULD GOVERN WHETHER THEY LIVED OR DIED 
tst2013.talkid1637_043 NOW WE MIGHT JUST AS EASILY CALL THESE FEARS BY A DIFFERENT NAME 
tst2013.talkid1637_044 WHAT IF INSTEAD OF CALLING THEM FEARS WE CALLED THEM STORIES 
tst2013.talkid1637_045 BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHAT FEAR IS IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT 
tst2013.talkid1637_046 IT 'S A KIND OF UNINTENTIONAL STORYTELLING THAT WE ARE ALL BORN KNOWING HOW TO DO 
tst2013.talkid1637_047 AND FEARS AND STORYTELLING HAVE THE SAME COMPONENT 
tst2013.talkid1637_048 THEY HAVE THE SAME ARCHITECTURE 
tst2013.talkid1637_049 LIKE ALL STORIES FEARS HAVE CHARACTERS 
tst2013.talkid1637_050 IN OUR FEARS CHARACTERS ARE US 
tst2013.talkid1637_051 FEARS ALSO HAVE PLOTS THEY HAVE BEGINNINGS AND MIDDLES AND ENDS 
tst2013.talkid1637_052 YOU BOARD THE PLANE THE PLANE TAKES OFF THE ENGINE FAILS 
tst2013.talkid1637_053 OUR FEARS ALSO TEND TO CONTAIN IMAGERY THAT CAN BE EVERY BIT AS VIVID AS WHAT YOU MIGHT FIND IN THE PAGES OF A NOVEL 
tst2013.talkid1637_054 PICTURE A CANNIBAL HUMAN TEETH SINKING INTO HUMAN SKIN HUMAN FLESH ROASTING OVER A FIRE 
tst2013.talkid1637_055 FEARS ALSO HAVE SUSPENSE 
tst2013.talkid1637_056 IF I 'VE DONE MY JOB AS A STORYTELLER TODAY YOU SHOULD BE WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MEN OF THE WHALESHIP ESSEX 
tst2013.talkid1637_057 OUR FEARS PROVOKE IN US A VERY SIMILAR FORM OF SUSPENSE 
tst2013.talkid1637_058 JUST LIKE ALL GREAT STORIES OUR FEARS FOCUS OUR ATTENTION ON A QUESTION THAT IS AS IMPORTANT IN LIFE AS IT IS IN LITERATURE WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT 
tst2013.talkid1637_059 IN OTHER WORDS OUR FEARS MAKE US THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE 
tst2013.talkid1637_060 AND HUMANS BY THE WAY ARE THE ONLY CREATURES CAPABLE OF THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE IN THIS WAY OF PROJECTING OURSELVES FORWARD IN TIME AND THIS MENTAL TIME TRAVEL IS JUST ONE MORE THING THAT FEARS HAVE IN COMMON WITH STORYTELLING 
tst2013.talkid1637_061 AS A WRITER I CAN TELL YOU THAT A BIG PART OF WRITING FICTION IS LEARNING TO PREDICT HOW ONE EVENT IN A STORY WILL AFFECT ALL THE OTHER EVENTS AND FEAR WORKS IN THAT SAME WAY 
tst2013.talkid1637_062 IN FEAR JUST LIKE IN FICTION ONE THING ALWAYS LEADS TO ANOTHER 
tst2013.talkid1637_063 WHEN I WAS WRITING MY FIRST NOVEL THE AGE OF MIRACLES I SPENT MONTHS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE ROTATION OF THE EARTH SUDDENLY BEGAN TO SLOW DOWN 
tst2013.talkid1637_064 WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR DAYS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO OUR CROPS 
tst2013.talkid1637_065 WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR MINDS 
tst2013.talkid1637_066 AND THEN IT WAS ONLY LATER THAT I REALIZED HOW VERY SIMILAR THESE QUESTIONS WERE TO THE ONES I USED TO ASK MYSELF AS A CHILD FRIGHTENED IN THE NIGHT 
tst2013.talkid1637_067 IF AN EARTHQUAKE STRIKES TONIGHT I USED TO WORRY WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO OUR HOUSE WILL HAPPEN TO OUR TO MY FAMILY 
tst2013.talkid1637_068 AND THE ANSWER TO THOSE QUESTIONS ALWAYS TOOK THE FORM OF A STORY 
tst2013.talkid1637_069 SO IF WE THINK OF OUR FEARS AS MORE THAN JUST FEARS BUT AS STORIES WE THINK OF OURSELVES AS THE AUTHORS OF THOSE STORIES 
tst2013.talkid1637_070 BUT JUST AS IMPORTANTLY WE NEED TO THINK OF OURSELVES AS THE READERS OF OUR FEARS AND HOW WE CHOOSE TO READ OUR FEARS CAN HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT ON OUR LIVES 
tst2013.talkid1637_071 NOW SOME OF US NATURALLY READ OUR FEARS MORE CLOSELY THAN OTHERS 
tst2013.talkid1637_072 I WROTE ABOUT A STUDY RECENTLY OF SUCCESSFUL ENTREPRENEURS AND THE AUTHOR FOUND THAT THESE PEOPLE SHARED A HABIT THAT HE CALLED PRODUCTIVE PARANOIA WHICH MEANT THAT THESE PEOPLE INSTEAD OF DISMISSING THEIR FEARS THESE PEOPLE READ THEM CLOSELY THEY STUDIED THEM AND THEN THEY TRANSLATED THAT FEAR INTO PREPARATION AND ACTION 
tst2013.talkid1637_073 SO THAT WAY IF THEIR WORST FEARS CAME TRUE THEIR BUSINESSES WERE READY 
tst2013.talkid1637_074 AND SOMETIMES OF COURSE OUR WORST FEARS DO COME TRUE 
tst2013.talkid1637_075 THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS SO EXTRAORDINARY ABOUT FEAR 
tst2013.talkid1637_076 ONCE IN A WHILE OUR FEARS CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE 
tst2013.talkid1637_077 BUT WE CAN'T POSSIBLY PREPARE FOR ALL OF THE FEARS THAT ARE IMAGINATIONS CONCOCT 
tst2013.talkid1637_078 SO HOW CAN WE TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FEARS WORTH LISTENING TO AND ALL THE OTHERS 
tst2013.talkid1637_079 I THINK THE END OF THE STORY OF THE WHALESHIP ESSEX OFFERS AN ILLUMINATING IF TRAGIC EXAMPLE 
tst2013.talkid1637_080 AFTER MUCH DELIBERATION THE MEN FINALLY MADE A DECISION 
tst2013.talkid1637_081 TERRIFIED OF CANNIBALS THEY DECIDED TO FORGO THE CLOSEST ISLANDS AND INSTEAD EMBARKED ON THE LONGER AND MUCH MORE DIFFICULT ROUTE TO SOUTH AMERICA 
tst2013.talkid1637_082 AFTER MORE THAN TWO MONTHS AND SEE THE MEN RAN OUT OF FOOD AS THEY KNEW THEY MIGHT AND THEY WERE STILL QUITE FAR FROM LANDS 
tst2013.talkid1637_083 WHEN THE LAST OF THE SURVIVORS WERE FINALLY PICKED UP BY TWO PASSING SHIPS LESS THAN HALF OF THE MEN WERE LEFT ALIVE AND SOME OF THEM HAD RESORTED TO THEIR OWN FORM OF CANNIBALISM 
tst2013.talkid1637_084 HERMAN MELVILLE WHO USE THIS STORY AS RESEARCH FOR MOBY DICK WROTE YEARS LATER AND FROM DRY LAND QUOTE ALL THE SUFFERINGS OF THESE MISERABLE MEN OF THE ESSEX MY IN ALL HUMAN PROBABILITY HAVE BEEN AVOIDED HAD THEY IMMEDIATELY AFTER LEAVING THE WRECK STEERED STRAIGHT FOR TAHITI 
tst2013.talkid1637_085 BUT AS MELVILLE PUT IT THEY DREADED CANNIBALS 
tst2013.talkid1637_086 SO THE QUESTION IS WHY DID THESE MEN DREADED CANNIBALS SO MUCH MORE THAN THE EXTREME LIKELIHOOD OF STARVATION 
tst2013.talkid1637_087 WHY WOULD THEY SWAYED BY ONE STORY SO MUCH MORE THAN THE OTHER 
tst2013.talkid1637_088 LOOKED AT FROM THIS ANGLE THEIRS BECOMES A STORY ABOUT READING 
tst2013.talkid1637_089 THE NOVELIST VLADIMIR NABOKOV SAID THAT THE BEST READER HAS A COMBINATION OF TWO VERY DIFFERENT TEMPERAMENTS THE ARTISTIC AND THE SCIENTIFIC 
tst2013.talkid1637_090 A GOOD READER HAS AN ARTIST PASSION A WILLINGNESS TO GET CAUGHT UP IN THE STORY BUT JUST AS IMPORTANTLY THE READER ALSO NEEDS THE COOLNESS OF JUDGMENT OF A SCIENTIST WHICH ACTS TO TEMPER AND COMPLICATE THE READERS INTUITIVE REACTIONS TO THE STORY 
tst2013.talkid1637_091 AS WE 'VE SEEN THE MEN OF THE ESSEX HAD NO TROUBLE WITH THE ARTISTIC PART 
tst2013.talkid1637_092 THEY DREAMED UP A VARIETY OF HORRIFYING SCENARIOS 
tst2013.talkid1637_093 THE PROBLEM WAS THAT THEY LISTENED TO THE WRONG STORY 
tst2013.talkid1637_094 OF ALL THE NARRATIVES THEIR FEARS WROTE THEY RESPONDED ONLY TO THE MOST LURID THE MOST VIVID THE ONE THAT WAS EASIEST FOR THEIR IMAGINATIONS TO PICTURE CANNIBALS 
tst2013.talkid1637_095 BUT PERHAPS IF THEY'D BEEN ABLE TO READ THEIR FEARS MORE LIKE A SCIENTIST WITH MORE COOLNESS OF JUDGMENT THEY WOULD HAVE LISTENED INSTEAD OF THE LESS VIOLENT BUT THE MORE LIKELY TAIL THE STORY OF STARVATION AND HEADED FOR TAHITI JUST AS MELVILLE SAD COMMENTARY SUGGESTS 
tst2013.talkid1637_096 AND MAYBE IF WE ALL TRIED TO READ OUR FEARS WE TO WOULD BE LESS OFTEN SWAYED BY THE MOST SALACIOUS AMONG THEM 
tst2013.talkid1637_097 MAYBE THEN WE'D SPEND LESS TIME WORRYING ABOUT SERIAL KILLERS AND PLAYING CRASHES AND MORE TIME CONCERNED WITH THE SUBTLER AND SLOWER DISASTERS WE FACE THE SILENT BUILDUP OF PLAQUE IN ARTERIES THE GRADUAL CHANGES IN OUR CLIMATE 
tst2013.talkid1637_098 JUST AS THE MOST NUANCED STORIES AND LITERATURE ARE OFTEN THE RICHEST SO TO MY OUR SUBTLEST FEARS BE THE TRUEST 
tst2013.talkid1637_099 READ IN THE RIGHT WAY OUR FEARS ARE AN AMAZING GIFT OF THE IMAGINATION THAT KIND OF EVERYDAY CLAIRVOYANCE AWAY A GLIMPSE SAYING WHAT MIGHT BE THE FUTURE WHEN THEY'RE STILL TIME TO INFLUENCE HOW THAT FUTURE WILL PLAY OUT 
tst2013.talkid1637_100 PROPERLY READ OUR FEARS CAN OFFER US SOMETHING AS PRECIOUS AS OUR FAVORITE WORKS OF LITERATURE A LITTLE WISDOM A BIT OF INSIGHT AND A VERSION OF THAT MOST ELUSIVE THING THE TREE 
tst2013.talkid1637_101 THANK YOU 
tst2013.talkid1640_000 WE LIVE IN AN INCREDIBLY BUSY WORLD 
tst2013.talkid1640_001 THE PACE OF LIFE IS OFTEN FRANTIC OUR MINDS ALWAYS BUSY AND WE'RE ALWAYS DOING SOMETHING 
tst2013.talkid1640_002 SO WITH THAT IN MIND THAT LIGHT JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO THINK WHEN DID YOU LAST TAKE ANY TIME TO DO NOTHING 
tst2013.talkid1640_003 JUST TEN MINUTES UNDISTURBED 
tst2013.talkid1640_004 AND WHEN I SAY NOTHING I DO MEAN NOTHING 
tst2013.talkid1640_005 SO THAT 'S NO EMAILING TEXTING NO INTERNET NO TV NO CHATTING NO EATING NO READING NOT EVEN SITTING THERE REMINISCING ABOUT THE PAST OF PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE 
tst2013.talkid1640_006 SIMPLY DOING NOTHING 
tst2013.talkid1640_007 I SEE A LOT OF VERY BLANK FACES 
tst2013.talkid1640_008 MY THINKING IS PROBABLY HAVE TO GO A LONG WAY BACK 
tst2013.talkid1640_009 AND THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY THING RIGHT 
tst2013.talkid1640_010 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR MIND 
tst2013.talkid1640_011 THE MIND ARE MOST VALUABLE AND PRECIOUS RESOURCE THROUGH WHICH WE EXPERIENCE EVERY SINGLE MOMENT OF OUR LIFE THE MIND THAT WE RELY UPON TO BE HAPPY CONTENT EMOTIONALLY STABLE AS INDIVIDUALS AND AT THE SAME TIME TO BE KIND AND THOUGHTFUL AND CONSIDERATE IN OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHERS 
tst2013.talkid1640_012 THIS IS THE SAME MIND THAT WE DEPEND UPON TO BE FOCUSED CREATIVE SPONTANEOUS AND TO PERFORM AT OUR VERY BEST IN EVERYTHING THAT WE DO 
tst2013.talkid1640_013 AND YET WE DON 'T TAKE ANY TIME OUT TO LOOK AFTER IT 
tst2013.talkid1640_014 IN FACT WE SPEND MORE TIME LOOKING AFTER OUR CARS OUR CLOSE IN OUR HEAD THAN WE OKAY MAYBE NOT AHEAD BUT YOU SEE WHERE I'M GOING 
tst2013.talkid1640_015 THE THE RESULT OF COURSE IS THAT WE GET STRESSED 
tst2013.talkid1640_016 YOU KNOW THE MIND WHICH IS A WAY LIKE A WASHING MACHINE GOING ROUND AROUND NOT A DIFFICULT CONFUSING EMOTIONS AND WE DON'T REALLY KIND OF KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT AND THE THE SAD FACT IS THAT WE ARE SO DISTRACTED THAT WE NO LONGER PRESENT IN THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE 
tst2013.talkid1640_017 WE MISS OUT ON THE THINGS THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO US AND THE CRAZY THING IS THAT EVERYBODY 'S ASSUMES WELL THAT'S THE WAY LIFE IS SO WE JUST KIND OF GOT TO GET ON WITH IT 
tst2013.talkid1640_018 THAT 'S REALLY NOT HOW IT HAS TO BE 
tst2013.talkid1640_019 SO I WAS ABOUT ELEVEN WHEN I WENT ALONG TO MY FIRST MEDITATION CLASS 
tst2013.talkid1640_020 AND TRUST ME HAD ALL THE STEREOTYPES THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE THE SITTING CROSS LEGGED ON THE FLOOR THE INCENSE THE HERBAL TEA THE VEGETARIANS THE WHOLE DEAL BUT MY MOM WAS GOING AND I WAS INTRIGUED SO I WENT ALONG WITH 
tst2013.talkid1640_021 BUT ALSO SEEN A FEW KUNG FU MOVIES AND SECRETLY I KIND OF THOUGHT MIGHT GO TO LEARN HOW TO FLY BUT I WAS VERY YOUNG AT THE TIME 
tst2013.talkid1640_022 NOW AS I WAS THERE YOU KNOW I GUESS LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE I ASSUMED THAT IT WAS JUST AN ASPIRIN FOR THE MIND 
tst2013.talkid1640_023 YOU GET STRESSED TO DO SOME MEDITATION 
tst2013.talkid1640_024 AND REALLY THOUGHT THAT IT COULD BE SORT OF PREVENTATIVE IN NATURE AND SO WAS TWENTY WHEN A NUMBER OF THINGS HAPPENED IN MY LIFE IN QUITE QUICK SUCCESSION REALLY SERIOUS THINGS WHICH JUST FLIPPED MY LIFE UPSIDE DOWN AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I WAS INUNDATED WITH THOUGHTS INUNDATED WITH DIFFICULT EMOTIONS THAT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO COPE WITH 
tst2013.talkid1640_025 EVERY TIME I SORT OF PUSHED ONE DOWN ANOTHER ONE WOULD JUST SORT OF PUT BACK UP AGAIN 
tst2013.talkid1640_026 IT WAS A REALLY VERY STRESSFUL TIME 
tst2013.talkid1640_027 I GUESS WE WILL DEAL WITH STRESS IN DIFFERENT WAYS 
tst2013.talkid1640_028 SOME PEOPLE WILL BURY THEMSELVES IN WORK GRATEFUL FOR THE DISTRACTION 
tst2013.talkid1640_029 OTHERS WILL TURN TO THEIR FRIENDS AND FAMILY LOOKING FOR SUPPORT 
tst2013.talkid1640_030 SOME PEOPLE GET THE BOTTLE START TAKING MEDICATION 
tst2013.talkid1640_031 MY OWN WAY OF DEALING WITH IT WAS TO BECOME A MONTH 
tst2013.talkid1640_032 SO I QUIT MY DEGREE I HEADED OFF TO THE HIMALAYAS I BECAME A MONK AND I STARTED STUDYING MEDITATION 
tst2013.talkid1640_033 PEOPLE OFTEN ASK ME YOU KNOW WHAT I LEARNED FROM THAT TIME 
tst2013.talkid1640_034 WELL OBVIOUSLY CHANGE THINGS 
tst2013.talkid1640_035 LET 'S FACE IT BECOMING A CELIBATE MONK IS GOING TO CHANGE A NUMBER OF THINGS 
tst2013.talkid1640_036 BUT IT WAS MORE THAN THAT 
tst2013.talkid1640_037 YOU KNOW IT IT 'S TAUGHT ME GAVE ME A GREATER APPRECIATION AND UNDERSTANDING FOR THE PRESENT MOMENT 
tst2013.talkid1640_038 BY THAT I MEAN NOT BEING LOST IN THOUGHT NOT BEING DISTRACTED NOT BEING OVERWHELMED BY DIFFICULT EMOTIONS BUT INSTEAD LEARNING HOW TO BE IN THE HERE AND NOW HOW TO BE MINDFUL HOW TO BE PRESENT 
tst2013.talkid1640_039 I THINK THE PRESENT MOMENT IS SO UNDERRATED 
tst2013.talkid1640_040 SOUNDS SO ORDINARY AND YET WE SPEND SO LITTLE TIME IN THE PRESENT MOMENT THAT IT 'S ANYTHING BUT ORDINARY 
tst2013.talkid1640_041 THERE WAS A RESEARCH PAPER THAT CAME OUT OF HARVARD JUST RECENTLY THAT SAID ON AVERAGE OUR MINDS ARE LOST IN THOUGHT ALMOST FORTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THE TIME 
tst2013.talkid1640_042 FORTY SEVEN PERCENT 
tst2013.talkid1640_043 AT THE SAME TIME THIS SORT OF CONSTANT MIND WANDERING IS ALSO A DIRECT CAUSE OF UNHAPPINESS 
tst2013.talkid1640_044 NOW WE'RE NOT HERE FOR THAT LONG ANYWAY BUT SUSPEND ALMOST HALF OF OUR LIFE LOST IN THOUGHT AND POTENTIALLY QUITE UNHAPPY DUNNO DISAPPEAR IT 'S KIND OF SEEMS TRAGIC ACTUALLY ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT WHEN THERE 'S A A POSITIVE PRACTICAL ACHIEVABLE SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN TECHNIQUE WHICH ALLOWS OUR MIND TO BE MORE HEALTHY TO BE MORE MINDFUL AND LESS DISTRACTED 
tst2013.talkid1640_045 AND THE BEAUTY OF IT IS THAT EVEN KNOW IT KIND OF NEED ONLY TAKE ABOUT TEN MINUTES A DAY IT IMPACTS OUR ENTIRE LIFE 
tst2013.talkid1640_046 BUT WE NEED TO KNOW HOW TO DO 
tst2013.talkid1640_047 WE NEED AN EXERCISE WE NEED A FRAMEWORK TO LEARN HOW TO BE MORE MINDFUL 
tst2013.talkid1640_048 THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT MEDITATION IS 
tst2013.talkid1640_049 IT 'S FAMILIARIZING OURSELVES FOR THE PRESENT MOMENT 
tst2013.talkid1640_050 BUT WE ALSO NEED TO KNOW HOW TO APPROACH IT IN THE RIGHT WAY TO GET THE BEST FROM IT 
tst2013.talkid1640_051 AND THAT 'S WHAT THESE ARE FOUR IN CASE YOU CAN WONDERING BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE ASSUME THAT MEDITATION IS ALL ABOUT SORT OF STOPPING THOUGHTS GETTING RID OF EMOTIONS SOMEHOW CONTROLLING THE MIND BUT ACTUALLY IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THAT 
tst2013.talkid1640_052 IT 'S MORE ABOUT SORT OF STEPPING BACK SO SEEING THE THOUGHT CLEARLY WITNESSING IT COMING AND GOING EMOTIONS COMING AND GOING WITHOUT JUDGMENT BUT WITH A RELAXED FOCUSED MIND 
tst2013.talkid1640_053 SO FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW IF I FOCUS TOO MUCH ON THE BALLS THEN THERE'S NO WAY THAT I CAN RELAX AND TALK TO YOU AT THE SAME TIME 
tst2013.talkid1640_054 EQUALLY IF I RELAX TOO MUCH TALKING TO YOU THEN THERE'S NO WAY I CAN FOCUS ON THE BALLS I'M GOING TO DROP THEM 
tst2013.talkid1640_055 NOW IN LIFE AND IN MEDITATION THERE WERE TIMES WHEN THE FOCUS BECOMES A LITTLE BIT TOO INTENSE AND LIFE STARTS TO FEEL LIKE THIS 
tst2013.talkid1640_056 IS VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WAY TO LIVE LIFE AND WE GET THIS TIGHT AND STRESSED 
tst2013.talkid1640_057 AT OTHER TIMES WE MIGHT TAKE A FOOT OFF THE GAS A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH AND THINGS JUST BECOME A SORT OF LIKE THIS 
tst2013.talkid1640_058 OF COURSE IN MEDITATION AND THAT FALLING ASLEEP 
tst2013.talkid1640_059 SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR A BALANCE OF FOCUS RELAXATION WHERE WE CAN ALLOW THOUGHTS TO COME AND GO WITHOUT ALL THE USUAL INVOLVEMENT 
tst2013.talkid1640_060 NOW OR USUALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE LEARN TO BE MINDFUL IS THAT WE GET DISTRACTED BY THOUGHT 
tst2013.talkid1640_061 LET 'S SAY THIS IS AN ANXIOUS STORE 
tst2013.talkid1640_062 SO EVERYTHING 'S GOING FIND AND THEN WE SEE THE ANXIOUS THOUGHT AND IT DIDN'T REALIZE WORRIED ABOUT THAT 
tst2013.talkid1640_063 YOU GO BACK TO IT REPEATED OH I'M WORRIED 
tst2013.talkid1640_064 WHAT I REALLY AM WORRIED WOW SO MUCH ANXIETY 
tst2013.talkid1640_065 AND BEFORE WE KNOW IT RIGHT WE'RE ANXIOUS ABOUT FEELING ANXIOUS 
tst2013.talkid1640_066 YOU KNOW THIS IS CRAZY WE DO THIS ALL THE TIME EVEN ON EVERY DAY 
tst2013.talkid1640_067 IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE LAST TIME YOU HAD A WOBBLY TOOTH 
tst2013.talkid1640_068 YOU KNOW IT 'S WOBBLY AND YOU KNOW THAT IT HURTS 
tst2013.talkid1640_069 BUT WHAT DO YOU DO EVERY TWENTY THIRTY SECONDS 
tst2013.talkid1640_070 ON A AND WE REINFORCE THE STORYLINE 
tst2013.talkid1640_071 AND WE JUST KEEP TELLING OURSELVES AND WE DO IT ALL THE TIME IS ONLY IN LEARNING TO WATCH THE MIND IN THIS WAY THAT WE CAN START TO LET GO OF THOSE STORYLINES AND PATTERNS OF MINE 
tst2013.talkid1640_072 BUT WHEN YOU SIT DOWN AND YOU WATCH THE MIND IN THIS WAY YOU MIGHT SEE MANY DIFFERENT PATTERNS 
tst2013.talkid1640_073 YOU MIGHT FIND A MIND THAT REALLY SORT OF RESTLESS AND THE WHOLE TIME 
tst2013.talkid1640_074 DON 'T BE SURPRISED IF YOU FEEL A BIT AGITATED IN YOUR BODY WHEN YOU SIT DOWN TO DO NOTHING AND YOUR MIND FEELS LIKE THAT 
tst2013.talkid1640_075 YOU MIGHT FIND A MINUS VERY SORT OF DULL BORING AND IT'S JUST ALMOST MECHANICAL IT RESORTING TO SAYS IF YOU JUST GETTING UP GOING TO WORK THE SLATE GET UP 
tst2013.talkid1640_076 OR MIGHT JUST BE THAT ONE LITTLE NAGGING THOUGHT IT JUST GOES ROUND AROUND HIM AROUND YOUR MIND 
tst2013.talkid1640_077 WHATEVER IT IS MEDITATION OFFERS THE OPPORTUNITY THE POTENTIAL TO STEP BACK AND TO GET A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE TO SEE THAT THINGS ARE ALWAYS AS THEY APPEAR 
tst2013.talkid1640_078 YOU KNOW WE CAN CHANGE EVERY LITTLE THING THAT HAPPENS TO US IN LIFE BUT WE CAN CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE EXPERIENCE IT 
tst2013.talkid1640_079 THAT 'S THE POTENTIAL OF MEDITATION MINDFULNESS 
tst2013.talkid1640_080 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BURN ANY INCENSE AND YOU DEFINITELY DON'T HAVE TO SIT ON THE FLOOR 
tst2013.talkid1640_081 WE NEED TO DO IS TO TAKE TEN MINUTES OUT A DAY TO STEP BACK TO FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH THE PRESENT MOMENT SO THAT YOU GET TO EXPERIENCE THE GREATEST SENSE OF FOCUS AND CLARITY IN YOUR LIFE 
tst2013.talkid1640_082 THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
tst2013.talkid1646_000 I WAS SITTING WITH MY GIRLS ENJOY SIT HEY I WISH I COULD GET OFF MY BED 
tst2013.talkid1646_001 MY DADDY BECAUSE ME ALL THE TIME

tst2013.talkid1646_003 I HAVE IN HER FROM MANDATING NEEDS 
tst2013.talkid1646_004 AT THIS MOMENT I KNEW THE GIRLS NEEDED A WAY TO CONNECT WITH THEIR FATHERS 
tst2013.talkid1646_005 AND CAN DIVA MY NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION WE HAD THESE TYPES OF CONVERSATION US ALL THE TIME AS A WAY TO HELP GIRLS OF AFRICAN DESCENT PREPARE FOR THEIR PASSAGE INTO WOMANHOOD 
tst2013.talkid1646_006 THESE GIRLS JUST NEEDED A WAY TO INVITE THEIR FATHERS INTO THEIR LIVES ON THEIR OWN TERMS 
tst2013.talkid1646_007 SO I ACTUALLY GIRLS HOW CAN WE HELP OTHER GIRLS DEVELOP HELPED THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR FATHERS 
tst2013.talkid1646_008 LISTS HAVE A DANCE ONE GIRL SHOUT IT AND ALL THE GIRLS QUICKLY BACKED HER UP 
tst2013.talkid1646_009 THEY STARTED DREAMING ABOUT THE DECORATIONS INVITATIONS THE DRESSES THEY WERE GOING TO WEAR AND WHAT THEY FATHERS COOLER AND COULD NOWHERE 
tst2013.talkid1646_010 IT WAS OFF AND RUNNING BEFORE I COULD EVEN BLINK MASS BUT EVEN IF I COULD HAVE SLOWED DOWN THOSE GIRLS I WOULDN'T OF BECAUSE ONE THING THAT I HAVE LEARN FROM OVER A DECADE OF WORKING WITH GIRLS IS THAT THEY ALREADY KNOW WHAT THEY NEED 
tst2013.talkid1646_011 THE WISDOM LIVES AND SAD OF THEM 
tst2013.talkid1646_012 AS LONG AS THEY HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE MENTORSHIP AND RESOURCES THEY CAN BUILD WHAT THEY NEED NOT ONLY TO SO THAT DEATH BUT SO TO THRIVE 
tst2013.talkid1646_013 SO WE HAD A DANES AND GIRLS AND THEIR FATHERS CAME IN MALTA TO 
tst2013.talkid1646_014 THEY WOULD DRESS TO THE

tst2013.talkid1646_017 THEY REALLY ENJOY EACH OTHERS COMPANY 
tst2013.talkid1646_018 IT WAS A HUGE SAYS SENSE 
tst2013.talkid1646_019 AND THE GIRLS DECIDED TO MAKE IT AN ANNUAL EVENT 
tst2013.talkid1646_020 SO AS THE SEASONS CHANGED AND IT WAS TIME TO PLAN THE DANCE AGAIN ONE GIRL NAMED BRIANNA SPOKE UP AND SHE SICK MADAME CAN COME TO THE DANCE AND THIS WHOLE THING IS MAKING ME SAY 
tst2013.talkid1646_021 ONE THAT THE GIRLS ACTS

tst2013.talkid1646_023 WELL NOW CAN HE DOES GET OUT FOR A DAY ONE OF THE GIRLS 
tst2013.talkid1646_024 AND COME AND SHACK 
tst2013.talkid1646_025 THAT 'S WORSE THAN THAT HAVEN'T HIM HERE 
tst2013.talkid1646_026 IN THIS MOMENT ASKS OPPORTUNITY FOR THE GIRLS TO RISE TO THE OCCASION AND TO BECOME THEIR OWN HEROES 
tst2013.talkid1646_027 SO SEX WHAT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD DO ABOUT THIS 
tst2013.talkid1646_028 WE WON 'T EVERY GIRL TO EXPERIENCE TO DANCE RIGHT 
tst2013.talkid1646_029 SO TO CROSS THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT AND ONE GIRL SUGGESTED WHY DON'T WE JUST TAKE THE DATA SAY THE JAIL 
tst2013.talkid1646_030 MOST OF THE GIRLS DOUBT IT THE POSSIBILITY OF THAT AND SAY IT 
tst2013.talkid1646_031 IS GOING TO ALLOW A BUNCH OF LITTLE GIRLS DRESSED COME A SAD A JAIL AND THEY ASKED WHAT DID THAT IS AN SPONGEBOB SUITS 
tst2013.talkid1646_032 THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL THEM 
tst2013.talkid1646_033 I SAID GIRLS WELL WELL YOU NEVER KNOW 
tst2013.talkid1646_034 SO I LEFT WAS WRITTEN TO THE RICH MAN SITTING SHARE SANG COLLECTIVELY BACK EACH GIRL AND I WOULD HAVE TO SAY HE IS A VERY SPECIAL SUGAR 
tst2013.talkid1646_035 HE CONTACTED ME IMMEDIATELY AND SAY IT WENT EVER THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING FAMILIES IN SAGGED HIS DOORS ARE ALWAYS OPEN 
tst2013.talkid1646_036 BECAUSE ONE THING HE DID KNOW THAT WHEN FATHERS ARE CONNECTED TO THEIR CHILDREN IT IS LESS LIKELY THAT THEY WILL RETURN 
tst2013.talkid1646_037 SO SIXTEEN INMATES AND EIGHTEEN GIRLS WERE INVITED 
tst2013.talkid1646_038 THE GIRLS WERE ADDRESSED IN THIS SUNDAY BEST AND THE FATHERS TRADE IT IN THEIR YELLOW AND BLUE JUMPSUITS FOOT SHIRT INTERACTS 
tst2013.talkid1646_039 THE HULL 
tst2013.talkid1646_040 THEY SHARED A FULL HATED MALE OF CHICKEN AND FISH 
tst2013.talkid1646_041 THEY LAUGHED TOGETHER 
tst2013.talkid1646_042 IT WAS BEAUTIFUL 
tst2013.talkid1646_043 THE FATHERS AND DAUGHTERS EVEN EXPERIENCED OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A PHYSICAL CONNECTION SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF THEM DIDN'T EVEN HAVE FOR A WHILE 
tst2013.talkid1646_044 FATHERS WERE IN A SPACE WHERE THEY WERE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR DAUGHTERS PLATE AND PULL OUT HER CHAIR AND EXTEND HIS HANGING FOR DANCE 
tst2013.talkid1646_045 EVEN THE GUARDS CRASH 
tst2013.talkid1646_046 BUT AFTER THE DANCE WE ALL REALIZE THAT DEAD STILL WOULD BE IN JAIL 
tst2013.talkid1646_047 SO WE NEEDED TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT THEY COULD TAKE WITH THEM 
tst2013.talkid1646_048 SO WE BOARD AND FLIP CAMPS AND WE HAD THEM LOOK AT THE FLIP CANS AND JUST INTERVIEW EACH OTHERS THEY MESSAGES THEY HAVE THOUGHTS 
tst2013.talkid1646_049 THIS WAS GOING TO BE USED AS A TOUCHSTONE SO WHEN THEY STARTED TO MISS EACH OTHER AND FEEL DISCONNECTED THEY COULD RECONNECT THROUGH THIS IMAGE 
tst2013.talkid1646_050 AND NEVER FORGET THAT ONE GIRL LOOKED AND HER FATHER 'S HANDS WHAT THAT CAMERA AND SAID DADDY WHEN YOU LOOK AT ME WHAT DO YOU SEE 
tst2013.talkid1646_051 BECAUSE OUR DADDIES ARE MERITS THAT WE HAVE A FLATBED WHEN WE THE SAD ABOUT WHAT TYPE A MAN WE DESERVE AND HOW THEY SEE US FOR THE REST OF VIOLENCE 
tst2013.talkid1646_052 AND KNOW THAT VERY WELL BECAUSE I WAS ONE OF THE LUCKY GIRLS 
tst2013.talkid1646_053 ACTIVE HEAD MATH BARBER IN MY LIFE ALWAYS 
tst2013.talkid1646_054 HE 'S EVEN HERE TONIGHT 
tst2013.talkid1646_055 AND THAT IS WHY IT IS EXTREMELY SPECIAL FOR ME TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE GIRLS ARE CONNECTED TO THEIR FATHERS IS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO A SEPARATED BECAUSE OF BARBED WIRES AND METAL DOORS 
tst2013.talkid1646_056 WE HAVE JUST CREATED A FORM FOR GIRLS WHO HAVE HEAVY QUESTIONS ON THEIR HEART TO BE IN A POSITION TO ACTS THEIR FATHERS THOSE QUESTIONS AND GIVEN THE FATHERS THE FREEDOM TO ANSWER 
tst2013.talkid1646_057 BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE FATHERS I EVEN LEAVING WHAT THIS ONE THOUGHT WHAT TYPE OF ONE PREPARING TO PUT IN THE WORLD 
tst2013.talkid1646_058 BECAUSE A FATHER IS UNLOCKED IS DOES NECK ME HE SHOULD BE LOCKED OUT OF HIS DAUGHTER 'S LIFE 
tst2013.talkid1647_000 MY NAME IS CAMERON RUSSELL FOR THE LAST A LITTLE WHILE I'VE BEEN A MODEL 
tst2013.talkid1647_001 ACTUALLY FOR TEN YEARS 
tst2013.talkid1647_002 AND I FEEL LIKE THERE 'S AN UNCOMFORTABLE TENSION IN THE ROOM RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I SHOULD NOT HAVE ONE DISTRESS 
tst2013.talkid1647_003 SO LUCKY I BROUGHT AN OUTFIT CHANGE 
tst2013.talkid1647_004 THIS IS THE FIRST AFTER CHANGE ON THE TED STAGE SO YOU GUYS ARE PRETTY LUCKY TO WITNESS IT I THINK 
tst2013.talkid1647_005 IF SOME THAT WOMEN ARE REALLY HORRIFIED WHEN I CAME OUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME NOW BUT I 'LL FIND OUT LATER ON TWITTER 
tst2013.talkid1647_006 AND ALSO KNOW THAT I'M QUITE PRIVILEGED TO BE ABLE TO TRANSFORM WHAT YOU THINK OF ME IN A VERY BRIEF TEN SECONDS 
tst2013.talkid1647_007 NOT EVERYBODY GETS TO DO THAT 
tst2013.talkid1647_008 NEW SKILLS ARE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE SO GOOD THING IT WASN'T AND WITH 
tst2013.talkid1647_009 THE WORST PART IS PUTTING THE SWEATER OF MY HEAD BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN YOUR LEFT ME DON 'T DO ANYTHING WELLS OVER MY 
tst2013.talkid1647_010 ALL RIGHT 
tst2013.talkid1647_011 SO WHY DID I DO THAT 
tst2013.talkid1647_012 THAT WAS AWKWARD 
tst2013.talkid1647_013 WELL HOPEFULLY NOT AS AWKWARD AS THAT PICTURE 
tst2013.talkid1647_014 IMAGE IS POWERFUL BUT ALSO IMAGE IS SUPERFICIAL 
tst2013.talkid1647_015 I JUST TOTALLY TRANSFORMED WHAT YOU THOUGHT OF ME IN SIX SECONDS 
tst2013.talkid1647_016 AND IN THIS PICTURE I ACTUALLY NEVER HAD A BOYFRIEND IN REAL LIFE 
tst2013.talkid1647_017 I WAS TOTALLY UNCOMFORTABLE IN THE PHOTOGRAPHER WAS TELLING ME TO ARCH MY BACK AND PUT MY HAND AND THAT HAS HAIR 
tst2013.talkid1647_018 AND OF COURSE BARRING SURGERY OR THE FAKE TAN THAT I GOT TWO DAYS AGO FOR WORK THERE 'S VERY LITTLE THAT WE CAN DO TO TRANSFORM HOW WE LOOK AND HOW WE LOOK THOUGH IT IS SUPERFICIAL AND IMMUTABLE HAS A HUGE IMPACT ON OUR LIVES 
tst2013.talkid1647_019 SO TODAY FOR ME BEING FEARLESS MEANS BEING HONEST 
tst2013.talkid1647_020 AND I AM ON THIS STAGE BECAUSE I AM A MODEL 
tst2013.talkid1647_021 I'M ON THIS STAGE BECAUSE I AM A PRETTY WHITE WOMAN AND MY INDUSTRY WE CALL THAT A SEXY GIRL 
tst2013.talkid1647_022 AND I'M GOING TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS OF PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME BUT WITH AN HONEST TWIST 
tst2013.talkid1647_023 SO THE FIRST QUESTION IS HOW YOU BECOME A MODEL 
tst2013.talkid1647_024 AND I WAS JUST SAY I WAS SCOUTED BUT THAT MEANS NOTHING 
tst2013.talkid1647_025 THE REAL WAY THAT I BECAME A MODEL IS I WANT TO GENETIC LOTTERY AND I AM THE RECIPIENT OF A LEGACY AND MAYBE YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT IS A LEGACY 
tst2013.talkid1647_026 WELL FOR THE PAST FEW CENTURIES WE HAVE DEFINED BEAUTY NOT JUST AS HEALTH AND YOUTH AND SYMMETRY THAT WERE BIOLOGICALLY PROGRAM TO ADMIRE BUT ALSO AS TALL SLENDER FIGURES AND FEMININITY AND WHITE SKIN 
tst2013.talkid1647_027 AND THIS IS A LEGACY THAT WAS BUILT FOR ME AND IT 'S A LEGACY THAT I'VE BEEN CASHING OUT ON 
tst2013.talkid1647_028 AND I KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO ARE SKEPTICAL AT THIS POINT AND MAYBE THERE ARE SOME FASHIONISTAS WHERE LIKE WAIT NAOMI TYRA JOAN SMALLS LIU WEN 
tst2013.talkid1647_029 AND FIRST I COMMEND YOU IN YOUR MODEL KNOWLEDGE VERY IMPRESSIVE 
tst2013.talkid1647_030 UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE TO INFORM YOU THEN IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN OF VERY INSPIRED AND WHY YOU PH D STUDENT COUNTED ALL THE MODELS ON THE RUNWAY EVERY SINGLE ONE WAS HIRED AND OF THE SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN MODELS THAT WERE HIRED ONLY TWENTY SEVEN WERE LESS THAN FOUR PERCENT OR NON WHITE 
tst2013.talkid1647_031 AND IT 'S QUESTION PEOPLE ASK ME IS CAN I BE A MODEL WHEN I GROW UP 
tst2013.talkid1647_032 AND THE FIRST ANSWER IS I DON'T KNOW THEY DON'T PUT IN CHARGE OF THAT 
tst2013.talkid1647_033 BUT THE SECOND ANSWER AND WHAT I REALLY WANT TO SAY THESE LITTLE GIRLS IS WHY 
tst2013.talkid1647_034 YOU KNOW YOU CAN BE ANYTHING 
tst2013.talkid1647_035 YOU COULD BE THE PRESENT UNITED STATES ARE THE INVENTOR OF THE NEXT INTERNET OR A NINJA CARDIO THORACIC SURGEONS POET WOULD BE AWESOME BECAUSE THE FIRST ONE 
tst2013.talkid1647_036 IF AFTER THIS AMAZING LIST THEY STILL ARE LIKE NO NO CAMERON I WANT TO BE A MODEL THEN I SAY THE MY BOSS 
tst2013.talkid1647_037 BECAUSE I'M NOT IN CHARGE OF ANYTHING AND YOU COULD BE THE EDITOR AND CHIEF OF AMERICAN VOGUE THE CEO OF HTM OR THE NEXT EVEN MYSELF 
tst2013.talkid1647_038 SAYING THAT YOU WANT TO BE A MODEL WHEN YOU GROW UP IS AKIN TO SAYING THAT YOU WANT TO WIN THE POWERBALL WHEN YOU GROW UP 
tst2013.talkid1647_039 OUT OF YOUR CONTROL AND IT 'S AWESOME AND IT'S NOT A CAREER PATH 
tst2013.talkid1647_040 I WILL DEMONSTRATE FOR YOU NOW TEN YEARS OF ACCUMULATED MODEL KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE UNLIKE CARDIO THORACIC SURGEONS IT CAN JUST BE DISTILLED RIGHT INTO RIGHT NOW 
tst2013.talkid1647_041 SO IF THE PHOTOGRAPHER IS RIGHT THERE AND THE LIGHT IS RIGHT THERE LIKE A NICE HIV AND THE CLIENT SAYS CAMERON WE WANT TO WALKING SHOT WITHIN THIS LEGOS FIRST NICE ALONG THIS ARM GOES BACK THIS ARM GOES FOR THE HEAD IS AT THREE QUARTERS AND YOU JUST GO BACK AND FORTH JUST DO THAT IF YOU LOOK BACK HERE IMAGINARY FRIENDS THREE HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED HUNDRED TIMES 
tst2013.talkid1647_042 IT WILL LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
tst2013.talkid1647_043 HOPEFULLY LESS AWKWARD THEM THAT ONE IN THE MIDDLE 
tst2013.talkid1647_044 WHAT WAS HAPPENING THERE 
tst2013.talkid1647_045 UNFORTUNATELY AFTER YOU'VE GONE TO SCHOOL AND YOU HAVE A RESUME AND YOU'VE DONE IF YOU JOBS YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING ANYMORE SO IF YOU SAY YOU WANT TO BE THE PRESENT THE UNITED STATES BUT YOU'RE RESUME READS UNDERWEAR MODEL TEN YEARS PEOPLE GIVE YOU A FUNNY WORK 
tst2013.talkid1647_046 THE NEXT QUESTION WE'VE ALWAYS ASK ME IS DO THEY RETOUCH ALL THE PHOTOS 
tst2013.talkid1647_047 AND YET THEY PRETTY MUCH RETOUCH ALL THE PHOTOS BUT THAT IS ONLY A SMALL COMPONENT OF WHAT'S HAPPENING 
tst2013.talkid1647_048 THIS PICTURE IS A VERY FIRST PICTURE THAT I EVER TOOK AND IT 'S ALSO THE VERY FIRST TIME THAT I HAD WANTED BIKINI AND I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE MY PERIOD YET 
tst2013.talkid1647_049 YOU KNOW WE'RE GETTING PERSONAL BUT YOU KNOW I WAS A YOUNG GIRL 
tst2013.talkid1647_050 THIS IS WHAT I LOOKED LIKE WITH MY GRANDMA JUST A FEW MONTHS EARLIER 
tst2013.talkid1647_051 HERE 'S ME ON THE SAME DAY AS THIS SHOE 
tst2013.talkid1647_052 MY FRIEND GOT TO COME WITH ME 
tst2013.talkid1647_053 HERE 'S ME AT A SLUMBER PARTY A FEW DAYS BEFORE SHOT FRENCH VOGUE 
tst2013.talkid1647_054 HERE 'S ME ON THE SOCCER TEAM AND V MAGAZINE 
tst2013.talkid1647_055 AND HERE 'S ME TODAY 
tst2013.talkid1647_056 AND I HOPE WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS THAT THESE PICTURES ARE NOT PICTURES OF ME 
tst2013.talkid1647_057 THEY ARE CONSTRUCTIONS AND THEY ARE CONSTRUCTIONS BY PROFESSIONALS BY HAIRSTYLES AND MAKEUP ARTISTS AND PHOTOGRAPHERS AND STYLISTS AND ALL OF THEIR ASSISTANCE AND PREPRODUCTION AND POST PRODUCTION AND THEY BUILD THIS THAT 'S NOT ME 
tst2013.talkid1647_058 OK SO THE NEXT QUESTION PEOPLE ASK ME AS YOU GET FREE STUFF 
tst2013.talkid1647_059 I DO HAVE TO MANY EIGHT AND SHE WAS THAT HAD NEVER GET TO WEAR EXCEPT EARLIER BUT THE FREE STUFF THAT I GET IS THE FREE STUFF THAT I GET IN REAL LIFE AND THAT'S WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT 
tst2013.talkid1647_060 I GREW UP IN CAMBRIDGE AND ONE TIME I WANTED TO STORE AND I FORGOT MY MONEY AND THEY GAVE ME THE DRESS FOR FREE 
tst2013.talkid1647_061 WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER I WAS DRIVING WITH MY FRIEND WHO WAS AN AWFUL DRIVER AND SHE RAN A RED AND OF COURSE WE GOT PULLED OVER AND ALL IT TOOK WAS A SORRY OFFICER AND WE WERE ON OUR WAY 
tst2013.talkid1647_062 AND I GOT THESE FREE THINGS BECAUSE OF HOW I LOOK NOT WHO I AM AND THERE ARE PEOPLE PAYING A COST FOR HOW THEY LOOK AND NOT WHO THEY ARE 
tst2013.talkid1647_063 I LIVE IN NEW YORK AND LAST YEAR OF THE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND TEENAGERS THAT WERE STOP AND FRISKED EIGHTY SIX PERCENT OF THEM WERE BLACK AND LATINO AND MOST OF THEM WERE YOUNG MEN 
tst2013.talkid1647_064 AND THERE ARE ONLY ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND YOUNG BLACK AND LATINO MEN IN NEW YORK SO FOR THEM IS NOT A QUESTION OF WILL I GET STOPPED 
tst2013.talkid1647_065 BUT HOW MANY TIMES I GUESS UP WHEN WHY GETS UP 
tst2013.talkid1647_066 WHEN I WAS RESEARCHING THIS TALK I FOUND OUT THAT OF THE THIRTEEN YEAR OLD GIRLS UNITED STATES FIFTY THREE PERCENT DON'T LIKE THEIR BODIES AND THAT NUMBER GOES TO SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT BY THE TIME THAT THEIR SEVENTEEN 
tst2013.talkid1647_067 SO THE LAST QUESTION PEOPLE ASK ME IS YOU KNOW WHAT IS IT LIKE TO BE A MODEL 
tst2013.talkid1647_068 AND I THINK THE ANSWER THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR IS IF YOU ARE A LITTLE BIT SKINNIER AND YOU HAVE SHINE YOUR HAIR YOU WILL BE SO HAPPY IN FABULOUS 
tst2013.talkid1647_069 AND WHEN WE'RE BACKSTAGE WE GIVE AN ANSWER THAT MAYBE MAKES IT SEEMED LIKE THAT 
tst2013.talkid1647_070 WE SAY IT'S REALLY AMAZING TO TRAVEL AND IT 'S AMAZING TO GET TO WORK WITH CREATIVE INSPIRED PASSIONATE PEOPLE 
tst2013.talkid1647_071 AND THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE BUT THEY'RE ONLY ONE HALF OF THE STORY BECAUSE THE THING THAT WE NEVER SAY ON CAMERA THAT I HAVE NEVER SAID ON CAMERA IS I AM INSECURE 
tst2013.talkid1647_072 AND I'M INSECURE BECAUSE I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT I LOOK LIKE EVERY DAY 
tst2013.talkid1647_073 AND IF YOU EVER ARE WONDERING IF I HAVE THINNER THIGHS AND SHINIER HAIR WILL I BE HAPPIER 
tst2013.talkid1647_074 YOU JUST NEED TO MEET A GROUP OF MODELS BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE THINNEST THIGHS AND THE CHINESE HERE IN THE COOLEST CLOTHES AND THE MOST PHYSICALLY INSECURE WOMEN PROBABLY ON THE PLANET 
tst2013.talkid1647_075 SO WHEN I WAS READING THIS TALK I FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO STRIKE AND HONEST BALANCE BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND I FELT VERY UNCOMFORTABLE TO COME OUT HERE AND SAY LOOK I RECEIVED ALL THESE BENEFITS FROM A DECK STACKED IN MY FAVOR AND IT ALSO FELT REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE TO FOLLOW THAT UP WITH AND IT DOESN'T ALWAYS MAKE ME HAPPY 
tst2013.talkid1647_076 BUT MOSTLY IT WAS DIFFICULT TO UNPACK THE LEGACY OF GENDER AND RACIAL OPPRESSION WHEN I'M ONE OF THE BIGGEST BENEFICIARIES 
tst2013.talkid1647_077 BUT I'M ALSO HAPPY HONORED TO BE UP HERE AND I THINK THAT IT 'S GREAT I GOT TO COME BEFORE TEN OR TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS HAD PASSED AND I HAD MORE AGENCY IN MY CAREER BECAUSE MAYBE THEN I WOULDN'T TELL THE STORY OF HOW I GOT MY FIRST JOB OR MAYBE I WOULDN'T TELL THE STORY OF HOW I PAID FOR COLLEGE WHICH SEEMS SO IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW 
tst2013.talkid1647_078 IF THERE 'S A TAKE AWAY TO THIS TALK I HOPE IS THAT WE ALL FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE ACKNOWLEDGING THE POWER OF IMAGE IN OUR PERCEIVED SUCCESSES AND ARE PERCEIVED FAILURES 
tst2013.talkid1647_079 THANK YOU 
tst2013.talkid1649_000 WHAT I WANT TO DO THIS AFTERNOON IS SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT SCHEDULE

tst2013.talkid1649_021 AND THE THING ABOUT IT I'VE DONE THIS FOR YEARS YOUNGER THEY ARE THE MORE FUN IT IS

tst2013.talkid1649_023 YOU KNOW THEM THEY'LL ALWAYS START YAKKING

tst2013.talkid1649_025 AND I LISTEN AND THE ARMY WHEN WE WANT YOU TO PAY ATTENTION WE HAVE A COMMAND IT'S CALLED AT EASE IT MEANS EVERYBODY BE QUIET AND PAY ATTENTION LISTEN UP 
tst2013.talkid1649_026 DO YOU UNDERSTAND 
tst2013.talkid1649_027 LET 'S PRACTICE EVERYBODY STARTED CHATTING 
tst2013.talkid1649_028 AND I LET HIM GO FOR ABOUT TEN SECONDS AND I GO 
tst2013.talkid1649_029 
tst2013.talkid1649_030 YES GENERAL YES GENERAL 
tst2013.talkid1649_031 TRY WITH YOUR KIDS CIVIL WAR 
tst2013.talkid1649_032 I DON'T THINK SO 
tst2013.talkid1649_033 PAUL BUT ANYWAY IT'S A GAME I PLAYED AND IT COMES OBVIOUSLY IF MY MILITARY EXPERIENCE 
tst2013.talkid1649_034 BECAUSE FOR THE MAJORITY OF MY ADULT LIFE I WORKED WITH YOUNG KIDS TEENAGERS WITH GUNS I CALL 
tst2013.talkid1649_035 AND WE WOULD BRING THEM IN THE ARMY AND THE FIRST THING WE WOULD DO IS TO PUT THEM IN A ENVIRONMENT OF STRUCTURE PUT THEM IN RANKS MAKE THEM ALL WHERE THE SAME CLOSE CUT ALL HER OFF SO THAT THE LIKE MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE STANDING IN RANKS 
tst2013.talkid1649_036 WE TEACH MEDICAL RIGHT FACE LEFT FACE SO THEY CAN OBEY INSTRUCTIONS AND KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT OBEYING INSTRUCTIONS 
tst2013.talkid1649_037 IT GIVES THEM STRUCTURE 
tst2013.talkid1649_038 AND THEN WE INTRODUCE INTO SOMEBODY WHO THEY COME TO HATE IMMEDIATELY THE DRILL SERGEANT 
tst2013.talkid1649_039 AND THEY HAVEN 
tst2013.talkid1649_040 AND THE DRILL SERGEANT STARTS SCREAMING AT HIM AND TELLING DO ALL KINDS OF AWFUL THINGS 
tst2013.talkid1649_041 BUT THEN THE MOST AMAZING THING HAPPENS OVER TIME 
tst2013.talkid1649_042 ONCE THAT STRUCTURE IS DEVELOPED ONCE THEY UNDERSTAND THE REASON FOR SOMETHING ONCE THEY UNDERSTAND MAMA AIN HERE 
tst2013.talkid1649_043 I'M YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE I'M YOUR DADDY AND YOUR MONEY 
tst2013.talkid1649_044 AND THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS YOU'VE GOT THAT SUN 
tst2013.talkid1649_045 AND THEN WHEN I ASK YOU QUESTIONNAIRE ONLY THREE POSSIBLE ANSWER YES OR NO SIR NO EXCUSE OR 
tst2013.talkid1649_046 DON'T START TELLING YOU WANT YOU DIDN'T DO SOMETHING 
tst2013.talkid1649_047 IT'S YES OR NO SIR NO EXCUSE FOR 
tst2013.talkid1649_048 YOU DIDN'T SHAVE BUT CERTAINLY DON'T TELL ME HOW OFTEN YOU SCRAPED YOUR FACE THIS MORNING 
tst2013.talkid1649_049 I'M TELLING YOU DIDN'T SHAPE 
tst2013.talkid1649_050 NO EXCUSE OR HAD A BOY LEARNING FAST 
tst2013.talkid1649_051 BUT YOU'D BE AMAZED AT WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH THEM ONCE YOU PUT THEM IN THAT STRUCTURE 
tst2013.talkid1649_052 IN EIGHTEEN WEEKS THEY HAVE A SKILL THEY ARE MATURE 
tst2013.talkid1649_053 AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY COME TO ADMIRE THE DRILL SERGEANT AND THEY NEVER FORGET THE DRILL SERGEANT 
tst2013.talkid1649_054 THEY COME TO RESPECT HIM 
tst2013.talkid1649_055 AND SO WE NEED MORE OF THIS KIND OF STRUCTURE AND RESPECT IN THE LIVES OF OUR CHILDREN 
tst2013.talkid1649_056 I SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH YOUTH GROUPS AND I SAY TO PEOPLE ONE IS THE EDUCATION PROCESS BEGIN 
tst2013.talkid1649_057 WE'RE ALL TALKING LET 'S FICTION SCHOOLS 
tst2013.talkid1649_058 LET 'S DO MORE FOR TEACHERS LET 'S PUT MORE COMPUTERS IN OUR SCHOOLS 
tst2013.talkid1649_059 WELL LET 'S GET ALL ONLINE 
tst2013.talkid1649_060 THAT ISN'T THE FOLD WHOLE ANSWER IT'S PART OF THE ANSWER 
tst2013.talkid1649_061 BUT THE REAL ANSWER BEGINS WITH BRINGING A CHILD TO THE SCHOOL WITH STRUCTURE IN THAT CHILD 'S HEART AND SOUL TO BEGIN WITH 
tst2013.talkid1649_062 WHEN DOES THE LEARNING PROCESS BEGINS BEGIN IN FIRST GRADE 
tst2013.talkid1649_063 NO NO IT BEGINS THE FIRST TIME A CHILD IN A MOTHERS ARMS LOOKS UP AT THE MOTHER AND SAYS OH THIS MUST BE MY MOTHER 
tst2013.talkid1649_064 SHE'S THE ONE WHO FEEDS ME 
tst2013.talkid1649_065 OH YEAH WHEN I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD DOWN THERE SHE KIND OF YOU KNOW TAKE CARE OF ME 
tst2013.talkid1649_066 IT 'S HER LANGUAGE I WILL LEARN 
tst2013.talkid1649_067 AND AT THAT MOMENT THEY SHUT OUT ALL THE OTHER LANGUAGES THAT THEY COULD BE LEARNING AT THAT AGE BUT BY THREE MONTHS THEY'VE THAT 'S HER 
tst2013.talkid1649_068 AND IF THE PERSON DOING WHETHER SOME OTHER GRANDMOTHER WHOEVER IS DOING IT THAT IS WHEN THE EDUCATION PROCESS BEGIN 
tst2013.talkid1649_069 THAT 'S WHEN LANGUAGE BEGINS 
tst2013.talkid1649_070 THAT 'S WHEN LOVE BEGINS THAT'S WHEN STRUCTURE BEGINS 
tst2013.talkid1649_071 THAT 'S WHEN YOU START TO IMPRINT ON THE CHILD THAT YOU ARE SPECIAL YOU ARE DIFFERENT FROM EVERY OTHER CHILD IN THE WORLD 
tst2013.talkid1649_072 AND WE'RE GOING TO READ TO YOU 
tst2013.talkid1649_073 CHILD HAS NOT BEEN READ TOO IS IN DANGER WHEN MY CHILD GETS TO SCHOOL 
tst2013.talkid1649_074 A CHILD WHO DOESN'T KNOW HIS OR HER COLORS OR DOES NOT TO TELL TIME IS NOT A TIE SHOES DOESN'T HOW TO DO THOSE THINGS AND DOESN'T HOW TO DO SOMETHING THAT GOES BY A WORD THAT WAS DRILLED INTO ME AS A KID MINE 
tst2013.talkid1649_075 MIND YOUR MANNERS MIND YOU ADULTS MINE WHICH ARE SAYING 
tst2013.talkid1649_076 THIS IS THE WAY CHILDREN ARE RAISED PROPERLY 
tst2013.talkid1649_077 AND I WATCHED MY OWN YOUNG GRANDCHILDREN NOW COME ALONG AND THERE ARE MUCH TO THE DISTRESS OF MY MY CHILDREN THEY ARE ACTING JUST LIKE WE DID YOU A PRINT THEM 
tst2013.talkid1649_078 AND THAT 'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO TO PREPARE CHILDREN FOR EDUCATION AND FOR SCHOOL 
tst2013.talkid1649_079 AND I'M WORKING IN ALL THE ENERGY I HAVE TO SORT OF COMMUNICATE THIS MESSAGE THAT WE NEED PRESCHOOL WE NEED HEADSTART WE NEED PRENATAL CARE 
tst2013.talkid1649_080 THE EDUCATION PROCESS BEGINS EVEN BEFORE THE CHILD IS BORN AND IF YOU DON'T DO THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE DIFFICULTY 
tst2013.talkid1649_081 AND WE ARE HAVING DIFFICULTIES AND SO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND SO MANY OF OUR SCHOOLS WERE KIDS ARE COMING TO FIRST GRADE IN THEIR EYES OF BLAZING THEY GOT THE LITTLE KNAPSACK ON THEIR READY TO GO AND THEN THEY REALIZED THEY'RE NOT LIKE THE OTHER FIRST GRADERS WHO KNOW BOOKS AND READ TOO CAN DO THEIR ALPHABET 
tst2013.talkid1649_082 AND BY THE THIRD GRADE THE KIDS WHO DIDN'T HAVE THAT STRUCTURE AND MINDING IN THE BEGINNING START TO REALIZE THEIR BEHIND WHAT THEY DO 
tst2013.talkid1649_083 THEY ACTED OUT THEY ACTED OUT AND THERE ON THEIR WAY TO JAIL ARE ON THEIR WAY TO BEING DROPOUTS 
tst2013.talkid1649_084 IT 'S PREDICTABLE 
tst2013.talkid1649_085 IF YOU'RE NOT AT THE RIGHT READING LEVEL AND THIRD GRADE YOU ARE A CANDIDATE FOR JAIL AT AGE EIGHTEEN AND WE HAVE THE HIGHEST INCARCERATION RATE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GETTING OUR KIDS A PROPER STARTED LIFE 
tst2013.talkid1649_086 THE LAST CHAPTER OF MY BOOK IS CALLED THE GIFT OF A GOOD START 
tst2013.talkid1649_087 GIFT OF A GOOD START EVERY CHILD WOULD HAVE A GOOD STARTED LIFE 
tst2013.talkid1649_088 I WAS PRIVILEGED TO HAVE THAT KIND OF GOOD START 
tst2013.talkid1649_089 I WAS NOT A GREAT STUDENT 
tst2013.talkid1649_090 I WAS A PUBLIC SCHOOL KID IN NEW YORK CITY AND I DIDN'T DO WELL AT ALL 
tst2013.talkid1649_091 I HAVE MY ENTIRE NEW YORK CITY BOARD OF EDUCATION TRANSCRIPT FROM KINDERGARTEN THROUGH COLLEGE 
tst2013.talkid1649_092 I WANTED IT WHEN I WAS WRITING MY FIRST BOOK 
tst2013.talkid1649_093 I WANT TO SEE IF MY MEMORY WAS CORRECT AND I GOT IT WAS 
tst2013.talkid1649_094 STRAIGHT C EVERYWHERE 
tst2013.talkid1649_095 AND I FINALLY BOUNCED THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL GOT INTO THE CITY COLLEGE OF NEW YORK WITH A SEVENTY EIGHT POINT THREE AVERAGE WHICH I SHOULDN 'T HAVE BEEN ALLOWED AND WITH AND THEN I STARTED OUT IN ENGINEERING AND THAT ONLY LASTED SIX MONTHS 
tst2013.talkid1649_096 AND THEN I WENT INTO GEOLOGY ROCKS FOR JOCKS THIS IS EASY 
tst2013.talkid1649_097 AND THEN I FOUND ROTC 
tst2013.talkid1649_098 I FOUND SOMETHING THAT I DID WELL AND SOMETHING THAT I LOVE DOING AND I FOUND A GROUP OF YOUNGSTERS LIKE ME WHO FELT THE SAME WAY 
tst2013.talkid1649_099 AND SO MY WHOLE LIFE THEN WAS DEDICATED TO ROTC IN THE MILITARY 
tst2013.talkid1649_100 AND I SAY TO YOUNG KIDS EVERYWHERE AS YOUR GROWING UP AN AGILE STRUCTURES BEING DEVELOPED INSIDE OF YOU ALWAYS BE LOOKING FOR THAT WHAT YOU DO WELL IN THAT WHICH WE LOVE DOING AND WHEN YOU FIND THOSE TWO THINGS TOGETHER MAN WHO GOT IT 
tst2013.talkid1649_101 THAT 'S WHAT 'S GOING ON AND THAT 'S WHAT I FOUND 
tst2013.talkid1649_102 NOW THE AUTHORITIES CEASING IN WHY WE'RE GETTING TIRED OF THE BEING THERE 
tst2013.talkid1649_103 I'VE BEEN THERE FOR A HALF GOING ON FIVE YEARS AND MY GRADES WERE NOT DOING PARTICULARLY WELL AND I WAS AN OCCASIONAL DIFFICULTIES WITH THE ADMINISTRATION 
tst2013.talkid1649_104 AND SO THEY SAID BUT IT DOES SO WELL ROTC 
tst2013.talkid1649_105 LOOKING GETS STRAIGHT A 'S IN THAT NOT ANYTHING ELSE 
tst2013.talkid1649_106 AND SO THEY SAID LOOK AT LET 'S LET 'S TAKE IS ROTC GRADES AND ROLL THEM INTO HIS OVERALL GPS AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
tst2013.talkid1649_107 AND THEY DID THEY PROBABLY HAVE TO TWO POINT 
tst2013.talkid1649_108 SO 
tst2013.talkid1649_109 IT 'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR GOVERNMENT WORK 
tst2013.talkid1649_110 GIVEN THAT THE ARMY WILL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN 
tst2013.talkid1649_111 SO THEY SHIPPING OFF THE ARMY AND LO AND BEHOLD MANY YEARS LATER I 'M CONSIDERED ONE OF THE GREATEST SUNS THE CITY COLLEGE OF NEW YORK HAS EVER HAD 
tst2013.talkid1649_112 I TELL YOUNG PEOPLE EVERYWHERE IT ANYWAY YOU START IN LIFE IT'S WHAT YOU DO WITH LIFE THAT DETERMINES WHERE YOU END UP IN LIFE AND YOU ARE BLESSED TO BE LIVING IN A COUNTRY THAT NO MATTER WHERE YOU START YOU HAVE OPPORTUNITIES SO LONG AS YOU BELIEVE IN YOURSELF YOU BELIEVE IN THE SOCIETY IN THE COUNTRY AND YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN SELF IMPROVEMENT EDUCATE YOURSELF AS YOU GO ALONG 
tst2013.talkid1649_113 AND THAT'S THE KEY TO SUCCESS 
tst2013.talkid1649_114 BY BEGINS WITH THE GIFT OF A GOOD START 
tst2013.talkid1649_115 YOU DON'T GET THAT GIFT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF OUR KIDS IF WE DON'T INVEST AT THE EARLIEST STAGE WE'RE GOING TO BE RUNNING AND DIFFICULTY 
tst2013.talkid1649_116 IT'S WHY WE HAVE DROPOUT RATE OF ROUGHLY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OVERALL AND ALMOST FIFTY PERCENT OF OUR MINORITY POPULATION LIVING AND LOW INCOME AREAS BECAUSE NOT GETTING THE GIFT OF A GOOD START 
tst2013.talkid1649_117 MY GIFT OF A GOOD START WAS NOT ONLY BEING IN A NICE FAMILY GOOD FAMILY BUT HAVING A FAMILY THAT SAID TO ME NOW LISTEN WE CAME TO THIS COUNTRY IN BANANA BOATS NINETEEN TWENTY IN NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR 
tst2013.talkid1649_118 WE WORKED LIKE DOGS DOWN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY EVERY SINGLE DAY 
tst2013.talkid1649_119 WHEN I DOING IT SO THAT YOU COULD STICK SOMETHING UP YOUR NOTICE OR GET IN TROUBLE AND EVEN THINK ABOUT DROPPING OUT 
tst2013.talkid1649_120 IF I EVER GONE HOME AND TOLLS IMMIGRANT PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW I'M TIRED OF SCHOOL ON DROPPING OUT THEY SAY WOULD DROP AND YOU OUT WITH ANOTHER KID 
tst2013.talkid1649_121 THEY HAD EXPECTATIONS FOR ALL OF THE COUSINS AND THE EXTENDED FAMILY OF IMMIGRANTS THAT LIVED IN THE SOUTH BRONX BUT THEY HAD MORE THAN JUST EXPECTATIONS FOR 
tst2013.talkid1649_122 THEY STUCK INTO OUR HEARTS LIKE A DAGGER A SENSE OF SHAME DON'T YOU SHAME THIS FAMILY 
tst2013.talkid1649_123 SOMETIMES I WOULD GET IN TROUBLE AND MY PARENTS WERE COMING HOME AND I WAS IN MY ROOM WAITING WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND I WOULD SIT THERE SAND MYSELF OKAY LOOK TAKE THE BELT AND HIT ME BUT GOD DON 'T GIVE ME THAT SHAME THE FAMILY BIT AGAIN 
tst2013.talkid1649_124 THE DEVASTATED ME WHEN MY MOTHER DID THAT TO ME 
tst2013.talkid1649_125 AND I ALSO HAD THIS EXTENDED NETWORK 
tst2013.talkid1649_126 CHILDREN NEED A NETWORK CHILDREN NEED TO BE PART OF A TRIBE A FAMILY COMMUNITY 
tst2013.talkid1649_127 IN MY CASE IT WAS AUNTS WHO LIVED IN ALL OF THESE TENEMENT BUILDINGS 
tst2013.talkid1649_128 I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU NEW YORKERS BUT THERE WERE THESE TENEMENT BUILDINGS AND THESE WOMEN WERE ALWAYS HANGING OUT ONE OF THE WINDOWS LEANING ON A PILLOW 
tst2013.talkid1649_129 THEY NEVER LEFT

tst2013.talkid1649_139 AND THEN YOU CAN SUPPORT US THAT'S THAT THAT'S THE ROLE OF YOU GUYS 
tst2013.talkid1649_140 AND SO IT 'S SO ESSENTIAL THAT WE KIND OF PUT THIS CULTURE BACK INTO OUR FAMILIES ALL FAMILY 
tst2013.talkid1649_141 AND IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT ALL OF YOU HERE TODAY WHO ARE SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE AND I'M SURE HAVE WONDERFUL FAMILIES AND CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN IT'S NOT ENOUGH YOU GOTTA REACH OUT BACK AND FIND KIDS LIKE MR CRUZ WHO CAN MAKE IT IF YOU GIVE THEM THE STRUCTURE IF YOU REACH BACK AND HELP A FEW MENTOR IF YOU INVEST IN BOYS AND GIRLS CLUBS IF YOU WORK WITH THE SCHOOL SYSTEM MAKE SURE IT'S THE BEST SCHOOL SYSTEM AND NOT JUST YOUR KIDS SCHOOL BUT THE SCHOOL UPTOWN IN HARLEM NOT JUST DOWNTOWN MONTESSORI ON THE WEST SIDE 
tst2013.talkid1649_142 ALL OF US HAVE TO HAVE A COMMITMENT TO DO THAT 
tst2013.talkid1649_143 I WOULD NOT JUST INVESTING IN THE KIDS 
tst2013.talkid1649_144 INVESTING IN OUR FUTURE 
tst2013.talkid1649_145 WE'RE GOING TO BE A MINORITY MAJORITY COUNTRY AND ONE MORE GENERATION 
tst2013.talkid1649_146 THOSE THAT WE CALL MINORITIES NOW GOING TO BE THE MAJORITY 
tst2013.talkid1649_147 AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE READY TO BE THE MAJORITY 
tst2013.talkid1649_148 WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT ARE READY TO BE THE LEADERS OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY OF OURS A COUNTRY THAT IS LIKE NO OTHER A COUNTRY THAT AMAZES ME EVERY SINGLE DAY COUNTRY THAT'S FRACTIOUS WERE ALWAYS ARGUING WITH EACH OTHER 
tst2013.talkid1649_149 THAT 'S HOW THE SYSTEM SUPPOSED TO WORK 
tst2013.talkid1649_150 IT 'S A COUNTRY SUCH CONTRASTS BUT IT'S A NATION OF NATIONS 
tst2013.talkid1649_151 WE TOUCH EVERY NATION EVERY NATION TOUCHES US 
tst2013.talkid1649_152 WE ARE NATION OF IMMIGRANTS 
tst2013.talkid1649_153 THAT'S WHY WE NEED SOUND IMMIGRATION POLICY 
tst2013.talkid1649_154 IT'S RIDICULOUS NOT TO HAVE A SOUND IMMIGRATION POLICY TO WELCOME THOSE WHO WANT TO COME HERE AND BE PART OF THIS GREAT NATION OR WE CAN SEND BACK HOME WITH AN EDUCATION TO HELP THEIR PEOPLE RISE UP OUT OF POVERTY 
tst2013.talkid1649_155 MY GREAT STORIES I LOVE TO TELL IS ABOUT MY LOVE OF GOING TO MY HOMETOWN OF NEW YORK AND WALKING A PARKING AVENUE BEAUTIFUL DATA ADMIRING EVERYTHING AND SEEING ALL THE PEOPLE GO BLACK MOBILE WORLD 
tst2013.talkid1649_156 BUT I ALWAYS HAVE TO DO IS STOPPED AT ONE OF THE CORNER AND GET A HOTDOG FROM THE IMMIGRANT PUSHCART PEDDLER 
tst2013.talkid1649_157 GOT TO HAVE A DIRTY WATER DOG 
tst2013.talkid1649_158 AND NO MATTER WHERE I AM A WHAT I'M DOING IT GOT TO DO THAT 
tst2013.talkid1649_159 I EVEN DID ON US SECRETARY STATE 
tst2013.talkid1649_160 TO COME OUT OF MY SWEET AT THE WORLD OFTEN STORY WALKING UP THE STREET AND I WOULD HIT AROUND FIFTY FIFTH STREET LOOKING FOR THE IMMIGRANT PUSHCART PEDDLER 
tst2013.talkid1649_161 IN THOSE DAYS I FIVE BODYGUARDS AROUND ME AND THREE NEW YORK CITY POLICE CARS WITH ALL ALONGSIDE TO MAKE SHREDDED NOBODY WHACK MEANWHILE I WAS GOING APART 
tst2013.talkid1649_162 AND I WOULD OR A HOTDOG FROM THE GUY AND HE STARTS TO FIX IT AND THEN YOU LOOK AROUND THE BODYGUARDS AND THE POLICE BECAUSE I'VE GOT A GREEN CARD I'VE GOT A GREEN CARD 
tst2013.talkid1649_163 
tst2013.talkid1649_164 AND NOW MY LOAN I'M ALONE 
tst2013.talkid1649_165 I'M GOING TO BODYGUARDS ARE GOING TO POLICE KIND OF NOTHING 
tst2013.talkid1649_166 BUT I GOTTA HAVE MY HOT DOG 
tst2013.talkid1649_167 I DID IT JUST LAST WEEK IT WAS ON A TUESDAY EVENING DOWN BY COLUMBUS CIRCLE 
tst2013.talkid1649_168 AND THE SCENE REPEATS ITSELF SO OFTEN 
tst2013.talkid1649_169 I'LL GO UP AND HAVE SOMEHOW TALK AND THE GUY WILL FIX IT AND AS HE 'S FINISHING I KNOW YOU I SEE ON TV 
tst2013.talkid1649_170 YOUR REGIONAL POWER 
tst2013.talkid1649_171 AND ALL THE MONEY 
tst2013.talkid1649_172 NOW GENERAL CAMPAIGN WE HAVE BEEN PAID 
tst2013.talkid1649_173 AMERICAS PAID ME NEVER FORGET WHERE IT CAME FROM 
tst2013.talkid1649_174 BUT NOW I'M AN AMERICAN SIR THANK YOU 
tst2013.talkid1649_175 EXCEPT A GENEROSITY CONTINUE UP THE STREET AND IT'S WASHES OVER ME MY GOD SAME COUNTRY AGREE TO MY PARENTS THIS WAY NINETY YEARS AGO 
tst2013.talkid1649_176 SO WE ARE STILL THAT MAGNIFICENT COUNTRY BUT WE ARE FUELED BY YOUNG PEOPLE COMING UP FROM EVERY LAND IN THE WORLD AND IT IS OUR OBLIGATION AS CONTRIBUTING CITIZENS TO THIS WONDERFUL COUNTRY OF HOURS TO MAKE SURE THAT NO CHILD GETS LEFT BEHIND 
tst2013.talkid1649_177 THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
tst2013.talkid1651_000 THIS IS HOW WAR STARTS 
tst2013.talkid1651_001 ONE DAY YOU'RE LIVING YOUR ORDINARY LIFE YOUR PLANNING TO GO TO A PARTY YOU'RE TAKING YOUR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL YOU'RE MAKING A DENTIST APPOINTMENT 
tst2013.talkid1651_002 THE NEXT THING THE TELEPHONES GO OUT THE TVS GO OUT THERE 'S ARMED MEN ON THE STREET THERE 'S ROADBLOCKS 
tst2013.talkid1651_003 YOUR LIFE AS YOU KNOW IT GOES INTO SUSPENDED ANIMATION 
tst2013.talkid1651_004 STOP 
tst2013.talkid1651_005 I'M GOING TO STEAL A STORY FROM A FRIEND OF MINE A BOSNIAN FRIEND ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HER BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL ILLUSTRATE FOR YOU EXACTLY WHAT IT FEELS LIKE 
tst2013.talkid1651_006 SHE WAS WALKING TO WORK ONE DAY IN APRIL NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY TWO IN A MINISKIRT AND HIGH HEELS SHE WORKED IN A BANK 
tst2013.talkid1651_007 SHE WAS A YOUNG MOTHER SHE WAS SOMEONE WHO LIKE TO PARTY 
tst2013.talkid1651_008 GREAT PERSON 
tst2013.talkid1651_009 AND SUDDENLY SHE SEES A TANK AMBLING DOWN THE MAIN ROAD OF SARAJEVO KNOCKING EVERYTHING OUT OF ITS PATH 
tst2013.talkid1651_010 SHE THINKS SHE'S DREAMING BUT SHE 'S NOT 
tst2013.talkid1651_011 AND SHE RUNS AS ANY OF US WOULD HAVE DONE AND TAKES COVER AND SHE HIDES BEHIND A TRASH BIN IN HER HIGH HEELS AND HER MINISKIRT 
tst2013.talkid1651_012 AND AS SHE 'S HIDING THEIR SHE'S FEELING RIDICULOUS BUT SHE'S SEEING THIS TANK GO BY WAS SOLDIERS AND PEOPLE ALL OVER THE PLACE AND CHAOS AND SHE THINKS I FEEL LIKE ALICE IN WONDERLAND GOING DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE DOWN DOWN DOWN INTO CHAOS AND MY LIFE WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN 
tst2013.talkid1651_013 A FEW WEEKS LATER MY FRIEND WAS IN A CROWD OF PEOPLE PUSHING WITH HER INFANT SUN IN HER ARMS TO GIVE HIM TO A STRANGER ON A BUS WHICH WAS ONE OF THE LAST BUSES LEAVING SARAJEVO TO TAKE CHILDREN OUT SO THEY COULD BE SAFE 
tst2013.talkid1651_014 AND SHE REMEMBERS STRUGGLING WITH HER MOTHER TO THE FRONT CROWDS AND CROWDS OF PEOPLE TAKE MY CHILD TAKE MY CHILD 
tst2013.talkid1651_015 AND PASSING HER SON TO SOMEONE THROUGH A WINDOW 
tst2013.talkid1651_016 AND SHE DIDN'T SEE HIM FOR YEARS 
tst2013.talkid1651_017 THE SIEGE WENT ON FOR THREE AND A HALF YEARS AND IT WAS A SEED WITHOUT WATER WITHOUT POWER WITHOUT ELECTRICITY WITHOUT HEAT WITHOUT FOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF EUROPE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY 
tst2013.talkid1651_018 I HAD ARMOR A BEING ONE OF THOSE REPORTERS THAT LIVED THROUGH THAT SIEGE AND I SAY I HAVE THE HONOUR IN THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING THERE BECAUSE IT 'S TAUGHT ME EVERYTHING NOT JUST ABOUT BEING A REPORTER BUT ABOUT BEING A HUMAN BEING 
tst2013.talkid1651_019 I LEARNED ABOUT COMPASSION 
tst2013.talkid1651_020 I LEARNED ABOUT ORDINARY PEOPLE WHO COULD BE HEROES 
tst2013.talkid1651_021 I LEARNED ABOUT SHARING I LEARNED ABOUT CAMARADERIE 
tst2013.talkid1651_022 MOST OF ALL I LEARNED ABOUT LOVE 
tst2013.talkid1651_023 EVEN IN THE MIDST OF TERRIBLE DESTRUCTION AND DEATH AND CHAOS I LEARNED HOW ORDINARY PEOPLE COULD HELP THEIR NEIGHBORS SHARE FOOD RAISE THEIR CHILDREN DRAG SOMEONE WHO 'S BEING SNIPED AT FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD EVEN THOUGH YOU YOURSELF ARE ENDANGERING YOUR LIFE HELPING PEOPLE GET INTO TAXIS WHO WERE INJURED TO TRY TO TAKE THEM TO HOSPITALS 
tst2013.talkid1651_024 I LEARNED SO MUCH ABOUT MYSELF 
tst2013.talkid1651_025 MARTHA GELLHORN WHO IS ONE OF MY HEROES ONCE SAID YOU CAN ONLY LOVE ONE WAR THE REST IS RESPONSIBILITY 
tst2013.talkid1651_026 I WENT ON TO COVER MANY MANY MANY WARS AFTER THAT SO MANY THAT I LOST COUNT BUT THERE WAS NOTHING LIKE SARAJEVO 
tst2013.talkid1651_027 LAST APRIL I WENT BACK TO A VERY STRANGE WHAT I CALL THE DERANGED HIGH SCHOOL REUNION 
tst2013.talkid1651_028 WHAT IT WAS WAS THE TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SIEGE THE BEGINNING OF THE SIEGE OF SARAJEVO AND I DON'T LIKE THE WORD ANNIVERSARY BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE A PARTY AND THIS WAS NOT A PARTY 
tst2013.talkid1651_029 IT WAS A VERY SOMBER GATHERING OF THE REPORTERS THAT WORK THERE DURING THE WAR HUMANITARIAN AID WORKERS AND OF COURSE THE BRAVE AND COURAGEOUS PEOPLE OF SARAJEVO THEMSELVES 
tst2013.talkid1651_030 AND THE THING THAT STRUCK ME THE MOST THAT BROKE MY HEART WAS WALKING DOWN THE MAIN STREET OF SARAJEVO WHERE MY FRIEND AIDA SAW THE TANK COMING TWENTY YEARS AGO AND IN THAT ROAD WERE TWELVE THOUSAND MORE THAN TWELVE THOUSAND RED CHAIRS EMPTY AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM SYMBOLIZED A PERSON WHO HAD DIED DURING THE SIEGE JUST IN SARAJEVO NOT IN ALL OF BOSNIA AND IT STRETCHED FROM ONE END OF THE CITY TO A LARGE PART OF IT AND THE SADDEST FOR ME WITH A TINY LITTLE CHAIRS FOR THE CHILDREN 
tst2013.talkid1651_031 I NOW COVER SYRIA AND I STARTED REPORTING IT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT IT NEEDS TO BE DONE 
tst2013.talkid1651_032 I BELIEVE A STORY THERE HAS TO BE TOLD 
tst2013.talkid1651_033 I SEE AGAIN A TEMPLATE OF THE WAR IN BOSNIA 
tst2013.talkid1651_034 AND WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED IN DAMASCUS I SAW THIS STRANGE MOMENT WHERE PEOPLE DIDN'T SEEM TO BELIEVE THAT WAR WAS GOING TO DESCEND AND IT WAS EXACTLY THE SAME IN BOSNIA NEARLY EVERY OTHER COUNTRY I'VE SEEN WHERE WAR COMES 
tst2013.talkid1651_035 PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE IT 'S COMING SO THEY DON'T LEAVE THEY DON'T LEAVE BEFORE THEY CAN 
tst2013.talkid1651_036 THEY DON'T GET THEIR MONEY OUT 
tst2013.talkid1651_037 THEY STAY BECAUSE YOU WANT TO STAY IN YOUR HOME 
tst2013.talkid1651_038 AND THEN WAR AND CHAOS DESCEND 
tst2013.talkid1651_039 RWANDA IS A PLACE THAT HAUNTS ME A LOT 
tst2013.talkid1651_040 IN NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR I BRIEFLY LEFT SARAJEVO TO GO REPORT THE GENOCIDE IN RWANDA 
tst2013.talkid1651_041 BETWEEN APRIL AND AUGUST NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY FOUR ONE MILLION PEOPLE WERE SLAUGHTERED 
tst2013.talkid1651_042 NOW IF THOSE TWELVE THOUSAND CHAIRS FREAKED ME OUT WITH THE SHEER NUMBER I WANT YOU JUST FOR A SECOND TO THINK OF A MILLION PEOPLE 
tst2013.talkid1651_043 AND TO GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLE I REMEMBER STANDING LOOKING DOWN A ROAD AS FAR AS I COULD SEE AT LEAST A MILE AND THERE WERE BODIES PILED TWICE MY HEIGHT OF THE DEAD 
tst2013.talkid1651_044 AND THAT WAS JUST A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE DEAD 
tst2013.talkid1651_045 AND THERE WERE MOTHERS HOLDING THEIR CHILDREN WHO HAD BEEN CAUGHT IN THE LAST DEATH THROES 
tst2013.talkid1651_046 SO WE LEARN A LOT FROM WAR AND I MENTION RWANDA BECAUSE IT IS ONE PLACE LIKE SOUTH AFRICA WHERE NEARLY TWENTY YEARS ON THERE IS HEALING 
tst2013.talkid1651_047 FIFTY SIX PERCENT OF THE PARLIAMENTARIANS ARE WOMEN JUST FANTASTIC AND THERE 'S ALSO WITHIN THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTION NOW YOU'RE ACTUALLY NOT ALLOWED TO SAY HUTU OR TUTSI 
tst2013.talkid1651_048 YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO IDENTIFY ANYONE BY ETHNICITY WHICH IS OF COURSE WHAT STARTED THE SLAUGHTER IN THE FIRST PLACE 
tst2013.talkid1651_049 AND AN AID WORKER FRIEND OF MINE TOLD ME THE MOST BEAUTIFUL STORY OR I FIND A BEAUTIFUL 
tst2013.talkid1651_050 THERE WAS A GROUP OF CHILDREN MIXED HUTUS AND TUTSIS AND A GROUP OF WOMEN WHO WERE ADOPTING THEM AND THEY LINED UP AND ONE WAS JUST GIVEN TO THE NEXT 
tst2013.talkid1651_051 THERE WAS NO KIND OF COMPENSATION FOR YOU OR TUTSI EURO HUTU YOU MIGHT HAVE KILLED MY MOTHER YOU MIGHT HAVE KILLED MY FATHER 
tst2013.talkid1651_052 THEY WERE JUST BROUGHT TOGETHER IN THIS KIND OF RECONCILIATION AND I FIND THIS REMARKABLE 
tst2013.talkid1651_053 SO WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME HOW I CONTINUED TO COVER WAR AND WHY I CONTINUE TO DO IT THIS IS WHY 
tst2013.talkid1651_054 WHEN I GO BACK TO SYRIA NEXT WEEK IN FACT WHAT I SEE IS INCREDIBLY HEROIC PEOPLE SOME OF THEM FIGHTING FOR DEMOCRACY FOR THINGS WE TAKE FOR GRANTED EVERY SINGLE DAY 
tst2013.talkid1651_055 AND THAT 'S PRETTY MUCH WHY I DO IT 
tst2013.talkid1651_056 IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR I HAD A LITTLE BABY BOY AND I CALL HIM MY MIRACLE CHILD BECAUSE AFTER SEEING SO MUCH DEATH AND DESTRUCTION AND CHAOS AND DARKNESS IN MY LIFE THIS RAY OF HOPE WAS BORN 
tst2013.talkid1651_057 AND I CALLED HIM LOOK UP WHICH MEANS TO BRING YOUR OF LIGHT BECAUSE HE DID BRING HE DOES WHEN LIFE LIGHT MY LIFE 
tst2013.talkid1651_058 BUT I DIDN'T TALKING ABOUT HIM BECAUSE WHEN HE WAS FOUR MONTHS OLD MY FOREIGN EDITOR FORCED ME TO GO BACK TO BAGHDAD WHERE I HAD BEEN REPORTING ALL THROUGHOUT THE SADDAM REGIME AND DURING THE FALL OF BAGHDAD AND AFTERWARDS AND I REMEMBER GETTING ON THE PLANE IN TWO YEARS CRYING TO BE SEPARATED FROM MY SON AND WHILE I WAS THERE UP QUITE FAMOUS IRAQI POLITICIAN WAS A FRIEND OF MINE SAID TO ME WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE 
tst2013.talkid1651_059 WHY DON'T YOU WOULD LUCA 
tst2013.talkid1651_060 AND I SAID WELL I I HAVE TO SEE IT WAS TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR WHICH WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE INCREDIBLY BLOODY TIME IN IRAQ I HAVE TO SEE I HAVE TO SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE 
tst2013.talkid1651_061 I HAVE TO REPORTED 
tst2013.talkid1651_062 AND HE SAID GO HOME BECAUSE IF YOU MISS HIS FIRST TOOTH IF YOU MRS FIRST STEP YOU'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOURSELF 
tst2013.talkid1651_063 BUT THERE WILL ALWAYS BE ANOTHER WAR 
tst2013.talkid1651_064 UNDER SADLY WILL ALWAYS BE WARS 
tst2013.talkid1651_065 AND I AM DELUDING MYSELF IF I THINK AS A JOURNALIST AS A REPORTER AS A WRITER WHAT I DO CAN STOP THEM I CAN'T 
tst2013.talkid1651_066 I'M NOT COFFEE AND THEN HE CAN'T STOP WAR 
tst2013.talkid1651_067 HE TRIED TO NEGOTIATE SYRIAN COULDN'T DO IT 
tst2013.talkid1651_068 I'M NOT A U N CONFLICT RESOLUTION PERSON 
tst2013.talkid1651_069 I'M NOT EVEN A HUMANITARIAN AID DOCTOR AND I CAN'T TELL YOU THE TIMES OF HOW HELPLESS I FELT TO HAVE PEOPLE DYING IN FRONT OF ME AND I COULDN'T SAVE THEM 
tst2013.talkid1651_070 ALL I AM IS A WITNESS 
tst2013.talkid1651_071 MY ROLE IS TO BRING A VOICE TO PEOPLE WHO ARE VOICELESS 
tst2013.talkid1651_072 A COLLEAGUE OF MINE DESCRIBED IT IS TO SHINE A LIGHT IN THE DARKEST CORNERS OF THE WORLD 
tst2013.talkid1651_073 AND THAT 'S WHAT I TRY TO DO 
tst2013.talkid1651_074 I'M NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL AND SOMETIMES IT'S INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING BECAUSE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE READING INTO AVOID DO YOU FEEL LIKE NO ONE CARES 
tst2013.talkid1651_075 CARES ABOUT SYRIA WHO CARES ABOUT BOSNIA 
tst2013.talkid1651_076 WHO CARES ABOUT THE CONGO THE IVORY COAST LIBERIA SIERRA LEONE ALL OF THESE STRINGS OF PLACES THAT I WERE MEMBER FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE 
tst2013.talkid1651_077 BUT MY MET TODAY IS TO BEAR WITNESS AND THAT IS THE CRUX THE HEART OF THE MATTER FOR US REPORTERS WHO DO THIS 
tst2013.talkid1651_078 AND ALL I CAN REALLY DO IS HOPE NOT TO POLICYMAKERS OR POLITICIANS BECAUSE AS MUCH AS I 'D LIKE TO HAVE FAITH THAT THEY READ MY WORDS AND DO SOMETHING I DON'T DELUDE MYSELF 
tst2013.talkid1651_079 BUT WHAT I DO HOPE IS THAT IF YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING I SAID OR ANY OF MY STORIES TOMORROW MORNING OVER BREAKFAST IF YOU CAN REMEMBER THE STORY OF SARAJEVO OR THE STORY OF RWANDA AND I'VE DONE MY JOB 
tst2013.talkid1651_080 THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
tst2013.talkid1520_000 DOC EDGERTON INSPIRED WITH OUR AND CURIOSITY WITH THIS PHOTO OF A BULLET PIERCING THROUGH AN APPLE AND EXPOSURE JUST A MILLION 'T OF A SECOND 
tst2013.talkid1520_001 BUT NOW FIFTY YEARS LATER WE CAN GO A MILLION TIMES FASTER AND SEE THE WORLD NOT AT A MILLION OR A BILLION BUT ONE TRILLION FRAMES PER SECOND 
tst2013.talkid1520_002 A PRESENT YOU A NEW TYPE OF PHOTOGRAPHY FEMTO PHOTOGRAPHY A NEW IMAGING TECHNIQUE SO FAST THAT CAN CREATE SLOW MOTION VIDEOS OF LIGHT IN MOTION 
tst2013.talkid1520_003 AND WITH THAT WE CAN CREATE CAMERAS THAT CAN LOOK AROUND CORNERS BEYOND LINE OF SIGHT OR SEE INSIDE OUR BODY WITHOUT AN EXTRA AND REALLY CHALLENGE WHAT WE MEAN BY A CAMERA 
tst2013.talkid1520_004 AND IF I TAKE A LASER POINTER AND TURN IT ON AND OFF IN ONE TRILLIONTH OF A SECOND WHICH IS SEVERAL FEMTOSECONDS I 'LL CREATE A PACKET OF PHOTONS BARELY A MILLIMETER WIDE AND THAT PACKET OF PHOTONS THAT BULLET WILL TRAVEL AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT AND AGAIN A MILLION TIMES FASTER THAN AN ORDINARY BULLET 
tst2013.talkid1520_005 NOW IF YOU TAKE THAT BULLET AND TAKE THIS PACKET OF PHOTONS AND FIRE INTO THIS BOTTLE HOW WILL THOSE PHOTONS SHATTER INTO THIS BOTTLE 
tst2013.talkid1520_006 HOW DOES LIGHT LOOK IN SLOW MOTION 
tst2013.talkid1520_007 NOW THE WHOLE EVENT 
tst2013.talkid1520_008 NOW REMEMBER THE WHOLE EVENT IS EFFECTIVELY TAKING PLACE IN LESS THAN A NANOSECOND THAT 'S HOW MUCH TIME IT TAKES FOR LIKE TO TRAVEL BUT I'M SLOWING DOWN IN THIS VIDEO BY A FACTOR OF TEN BILLION SO YOU CAN SEE THE LIGHT IN MOTION 
tst2013.talkid1520_009 BUT COCA COLA DID NOT SPONSOR THIS RESEARCH 
tst2013.talkid1520_010 NOW THERE 'S A LOT GOING ON IN THIS MOVIE SO LET ME BREAKDOWN AND SHOW YOU WHAT 'S GOING ON 
tst2013.talkid1520_011 SO THE POLES ENTERS THE BOTTLE OUR BULLET WITH A PACKET OF PHOTONS THE START TRAVELING THROUGH AND THE STAR SCATTERING INSIDE 
tst2013.talkid1520_012 SOME OF THE LIGHT LEAKS GOES ON THE TABLE AND YOU START SEEING THIS RIPPLES OF WAYS 
tst2013.talkid1520_013 MANY OF THE PHOTONS EVENTUALLY REACH THE CAP AND THEN THE EXPLODE IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS 
tst2013.talkid1520_014 AS YOU CAN SEE THERE 'S A BUBBLE OF AIR AND BOUNCING AROUND INSIDE 
tst2013.talkid1520_015 MEANWHILE THE RIPPLES ARE TRAVELING ON THE TABLE AND BECAUSE OF THE REFLECTIONS AT THE TOP YOU SEE AT THE BACK OF THE BOTTLE AFTER SEVERAL FRAMES REFLECTIONS ARE FOCUSED 
tst2013.talkid1520_016 NOW IF YOU TAKE AN ORDINARY BULLET AND LET IT GO THE SAME DISTANCE AND SLOW DOWN THE VIDEO AGAIN BY A FACTOR OF TEN BILLION DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG ALLOWED TO SIT HERE TO WATCH THAT MOVIE 
tst2013.talkid1520_017 A DAY A WEEK ACTUALLY A WHOLE YEAR 
tst2013.talkid1520_018 IT WOULD BE A VERY BORING MOVIE ORDINARY BULLET IN MOTION 
tst2013.talkid1520_019 AND WHAT ABOUT SOME STILL LIFE PHOTOGRAPHY 
tst2013.talkid1520_020 YOU CAN WATCH THE RIPPLES AGAIN WASHING OVER THE TABLE THE TOMATO AND THE WALL IN THE BACK 
tst2013.talkid1520_021 IS LIKE TRYING A STONE IN OPPONENT OF WATER 
tst2013.talkid1520_022 BUT THIS IS HOW NATURE PAINT A PHOTO ONE FEMTO FRAME AT THE TIME BUT OF COURSE OUR HIGH SEAS AN INTEGRAL COMPOSITE 
tst2013.talkid1520_023 BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THIS TOMATO ONE MORE TIME YOU WILL NOTICE AS THE LIGHT WASHES OVER THE TOMATO IT CONTINUES TO GLOW IT DOESN'T BECOME DARK 
tst2013.talkid1520_024 WHY IS THAT BECAUSE THE TOMATO IS ACTUALLY RIGHT AND THE LIGHT IS BOUNCING AROUND INSIDE THE TOMATO AND IT COMES OUT AFTER SEVERAL TRILLIONTHS OF A SECOND 
tst2013.talkid1520_025 SO IN THE FUTURE WHEN THIS FEMTO CAMERA IS IN YOUR CAMERA PHONE YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO GO TO A SUPERMARKET AND CHECK IF THE FRUIT IS RIPE WITHOUT ACTUALLY TOUCHING IT 
tst2013.talkid1520_026 SO HOW DID MY TEAM AT MIT CREATE THIS CAMERA 
tst2013.talkid1520_027 NOW AS PHOTOGRAPHERS YOU KNOW IF WE TAKE A SHORT EXPOSURE PHOTO YOU GET VERY LITTLE LIGHT BUT WE'RE GOING TO GO A BILLION TIMES FASTER THAN YOUR SHORTEST EXPOSURE YOU CAN GET HARDLY ANY LIGHT 
tst2013.talkid1520_028 SO WHAT WE DO IS WE SEND THAT BULLET DOES PACKET OF PHOTONS MILLIONS OF TIMES AND RECORD AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH VERY CLEVER SYNCHRONIZATION AND FROM THE GIGABYTES OF DATA WE COMPUTATIONALLY WE'VE TOGETHER TO CREATE THOSE FEMTO VIDEOS I SHOWED YOU 
tst2013.talkid1520_029 AND WE CAN TAKE ALL THAT RAW DATA AND TREATED IN VERY INTERESTING WAYS 
tst2013.talkid1520_030 SO SUPERMAN CAN FLY 
tst2013.talkid1520_031 SOME OTHER HEROES CAN BECOME INVISIBLE BUT WHAT ABOUT A NEW POWER FOR THE FUTURE SUPERHERO TO SEE AROUND CORNERS 
tst2013.talkid1520_032 THE IDEA IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO SHINE SUNLIGHT ON THE DOOR 
tst2013.talkid1520_033 IT 'S GOING TO BONES GO INSIDE THE ROOM SOME OTHER GOING TO REFLECT BACK ON THE DOOR AND THEN BACK TO THE CAMERA I'M GOING TO EXPLOIT THIS MULTIPLE BOUNCES OF LIGHT 
tst2013.talkid1520_034 AND FOR SCIENCE FICTION WE HAVE ACTUALLY BUILT IT 
tst2013.talkid1520_035 ON THE LEFT YOU SEE OR FEMTO CAMERA 
tst2013.talkid1520_036 THERE 'S A MANNEQUIN HIDDEN BEHIND A WALL AND WE'RE GOING TO BOUNCE LIGHT OF THE DOOR 
tst2013.talkid1520_037 SO AFTER A PAPER WAS PUBLISHED IN NATURE COMMUNICATION IT WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY NATURE DOTCOM AND THEY CREATED THIS ANIMATION 
tst2013.talkid1520_038 WE'RE GOING TO FIRE THOSE PLATES OF LIGHT AND THEY GOT HIT THIS WALL AND BECAUSE THE PACKET OF PHOTONS THEY WERE SCATTER IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND SOME OF THEM WILL REACH OUT HIDDEN MANIC IN WHICH IN TURN AGAINST CATTLE THAT LIGHT AND AGAIN IN TURN THE DOLLAR WILL REFLECT SOME OF THAT DISCOVER LIGHT AND A TINY FRACTION OF PHOTONS LIKE TO COME BACK TO THE CAMERA BUT MOST INTERESTINGLY THEY WILL ALL ARRIVE AT A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TIME SLOT 
tst2013.talkid1520_039 AND BECAUSE WE HAVE A CAMERA THAT CAN RUN SO FAST OUR FEMTO CAMERA IT HAS SOME UNIQUE ABILITIES 
tst2013.talkid1520_040 BECAUSE VERY GOOD TIME RESOLUTION AND IT CAN LOOK AT THE WORLD AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT 
tst2013.talkid1520_041 AND THIS WAY WE KNOW THE DISTANCES OF COURSE TO THE DOOR BUT ALSO TO THE HIDDEN OBJECTS BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHICH POINT CORRESPONDS TO WHICH DISTANCE 
tst2013.talkid1520_042 BY SHINING ONE LASER WE CAN RECORD WONDER A PHOTO WHICH YOU LOOK ON THE SCREEN DOESN 'T REALLY MAKE ANY SENSE BUT THE REMOTE A LOT OF SUCH PICTURES DOZENS OF SUCH PICTURES PUT THEM TOGETHER AND TRY TO ANALYZE THE MULTIPLE BOUNCES OF LIGHT AND FROM THAT CAN WE SEE THE HIDDEN OBJECT 
tst2013.talkid1520_043 CAN YOU SEE IT IN FULL TREATY 
tst2013.talkid1520_044 SO THIS IS OUR RECONSTRUCTION 
tst2013.talkid1520_045 NOW WE HAVE SOME WAYS TO GO BEFORE WE TAKE THIS OUTSIDE THE LAB ON THE ROAD BUT IN THE FUTURE WE COULD CREATE CARS THAT HOWARD COLLISION WITH WHAT AROUND THE BAND OR WE CAN LOOK FOR SURVIVORS IN HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS BY LOOKING AT LIGHT REFLECTED THROUGH OPEN WINDOWS OR WE CAN BUILD ENDOSCOPES THAT CAN SEE DEEP INSIDE THE BODY AROUND OCCLUDERS AND ALSO FOR CARDIOSCOPES 
tst2013.talkid1520_046 BUT OF COURSE BECAUSE OF TISSUE AND BLURRED THIS IS QUITE CHALLENGING SO THIS IS REALLY A CALL FOR SCIENTISTS TO START THINKING ABOUT FEMTO PHOTOGRAPHY AS REALLY A NEW IMAGING MODALITY TO SOLVE NEXT GENERATION OF HEALTH IMAGING PROBLEMS 
tst2013.talkid1520_047 NOW LIKE DOC EDGERTON A SCIENTIST HIMSELF SCIENCE BECAME ART AN ART OF ULTRA FAST PHOTOGRAPHY AND I REALIZED THAT THIS ALL THE GIGABYTES OF DATA THAT WE 'RE COLLECTING EVERY TIME IS NOT JUST FOR SCIENTIFIC IMAGING BUT WE CAN ALSO DO A NEW FORM OF COMPUTATIONAL PHOTOGRAPHY WITH TIME LAPSE AND COLOR CODING AND THEY LOOK AT THOSE RIPPLES REMEMBER THE TIME BETWEEN EACH OF THOSE RIPPLES IS ONLY A FEW TRILLIONTHS OF A SECOND 
tst2013.talkid1520_048 BUT IT ALSO SOMETHING FUNNY GOING ON HERE 
tst2013.talkid1520_049 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RIPPLES UNDER THE CAP THE RIPPLES ARE MOVING AWAY FROM US 
tst2013.talkid1520_050 THE REPORT SHOULD BE MOVING TOWARDS US 
tst2013.talkid1520_051 WHAT 'S GOING ON HERE 
tst2013.talkid1520_052 IT TURNS OUT BECAUSE WE 'RE RECORDING NEARLY AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT WE HAVE STRANGE EFFECTS AND EINSTEIN WOULD HAVE LOVED TO SEE THIS PICTURE 
tst2013.talkid1520_053 THE ORDER THAT WHICH EVENTS TAKE PLACE IN THE WORLD APPEAR IN THE CAMERA WITH SOMETIMES REVERSED ORDER SO BY APPLYING THE CORRESPONDING SPACE AND TIME WARP WE CAN CORRECT FOR THIS DISTORTION 
tst2013.talkid1520_054 SO WHETHER IT 'S FOR PHOTOGRAPHY AROUND CORNERS OR CREATING THE NEXT GENERATION OF HEALTH IMAGING OR CREATING NEW VISUALIZATIONS SINCE OUR INVENTION WE HAVE OPEN SOURCED ALL THE DATA AND DETAILS ON OUR WEBSITE AND OUR HOPE IS THAT THE DIY THE CREATIVE AND THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY WILL SHOW US THAT WHICH ARE STOP OBSESSING ABOUT THE MEGAPIXELS IN CAMERAS AND START FOCUSING ON THE NEXT DIMENSION IN IMAGING 
tst2013.talkid1520_055 IT'S ABOUT TIME THANK YOU 
tst2013.talkid1654_000 AND HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT A DISTURBING QUESTION WHICH HAS AN EQUALLY DISTURBING ANSWER 
tst2013.talkid1654_001 MY TOPIC IS THE SECRETS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THE QUESTION I'M GOING TO TACKLE IS THE ONE QUESTION EVERYONE ALWAYS ASKS WHY DOES SHE STAY 
tst2013.talkid1654_002 WHY WOULD ANYONE STAY WITH A MAN WHO BEATS HER 
tst2013.talkid1654_003 I'M NOT A PSYCHIATRIST A SOCIAL WORKER OR AN EXPERT IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
tst2013.talkid1654_004 I'M JUST ONE WOMAN WITH A STORY TO TELL 
tst2013.talkid1654_005 I WAS TWENTY TWO I HAD JUST GRADUATED FROM HARVARD COLLEGE 
tst2013.talkid1654_006 I'D MOVED TO NEW YORK CITY FOR MY FIRST JOB AS A WRITER AND EDITOR AT SEVENTEEN MAGAZINE 
tst2013.talkid1654_007 I HAD MY FIRST APARTMENT MY FIRST LITTLE GREEN AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD AND I HAD A VERY BIG SECRET 
tst2013.talkid1654_008 MY SECRET WAS THAT I HAD THIS GUN LOADED WITH HOLLOW POINT BULLETS POINTED AT MY HEAD BY THE MAN WHO I THOUGHT WAS MY SOULMATE MANY MANY TIMES 
tst2013.talkid1654_009 THE MAN WHO I LOVED MORE THAN ANYBODY ON EARTH HELD A GUN TO MY HEAD AND THREATENED TO KILL ME MORE TIMES THAN I CAN EVEN REMEMBER 
tst2013.talkid1654_010 I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE STORY OF CRAZY LOVE A PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAP DISGUISED AS LOVE ONE THAT MILLIONS OF WOMEN AND EVEN A FEW MEN FALL INTO EVERY YEAR 
tst2013.talkid1654_011 IT MAY EVEN BE YOUR STORY 
tst2013.talkid1654_012 I DON'T LOOK LIKE A TYPICAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVOR 
tst2013.talkid1654_013 I HAVE A B A IN ENGLISH FROM HARVARD COLLEGE AND BE A IN MARKETING FROM WHARTON BUSINESS SCHOOL 
tst2013.talkid1654_014 I SPENT MOST OF MY CAREER WORKING FOR FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES INCLUDING JOHNSON JOHNSON LEO BURNETT AND THE WASHINGTON POST 
tst2013.talkid1654_015 I'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS TO MY SECOND HAS BEEN AND WE HAVE THREE KIDS TOGETHER 
tst2013.talkid1654_016 MY DOG IS A BLACK LAB AND I DRIVE A HONDA ODYSSEY MINIVAN 
tst2013.talkid1654_017 SO MY FIRST MESSAGE FOR YOU IS THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HAPPENS TO EVERYONE ALL RACES ALL RELIGIONS ALL INCOME EDUCATION LEVELS 
tst2013.talkid1654_018 IT 'S EVERYWHERE 
tst2013.talkid1654_019 AND MY SECOND MESSAGE IS THAT EVERYONE THINKS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HAPPENS TO WOMEN THAT IT 'S A WOMEN 'S ISSUE 
tst2013.talkid1654_020 NOT EXACTLY 
tst2013.talkid1654_021 OVER EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF ABUSERS ARE MEN AND DOMESTIC ABUSE HAPPENS ONLY IN INTIMATE INTERDEPENDENT LONG TERM RELATIONSHIPS IN OTHER WORDS IN FAMILIES THE LAST PLACE WE WOULD WANT TO EXPECT TO FIND VIOLENCE WHICH IS ONE REASON DOMESTIC ABUSE IS SO CONFUSING 
tst2013.talkid1654_022 I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU MYSELF THAT I WAS THE LAST PERSON ON EARTH WHO WOULD STAY WITH A MAN WHO BEATS ME BUT IN FACT I WAS A VERY TYPICAL VICTIM BECAUSE OF MY AGE 
tst2013.talkid1654_023 I WAS TWENTY TWO AND IN THE UNITED STATES WOMEN AGES SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR ARE THREE TIMES AS LIKELY TO BE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS AS WOMEN OF OTHER AGES AND OVER FIVE HUNDRED WOMEN AND GIRLS THIS AGE ARE KILLED EVERY YEAR BY ABUSIVE PARTNERS BOYFRIENDS AND HUSBANDS IN THE UNITED STATES 
tst2013.talkid1654_024 I WAS ALSO A VERY TYPICAL VICTIM BECAUSE I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ITS WARNING SIGNS OR ITS PATTERNS 
tst2013.talkid1654_025 I MET CONOR ON A COLD RAINY JANUARY NIGHT 
tst2013.talkid1654_026 HE SAT NEXT TO ME ON THE NEW YORK CITY SUBWAY AND HE STARTED CHATTING ME UP 
tst2013.talkid1654_027 HE TOLD ME TWO THINGS 
tst2013.talkid1654_028 ONE WAS THAT HE TOO HAD JUST GRADUATED FROM AN IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL AND THAT HE WORKED AT A VERY IMPRESSIVE WALL STREET BANK 
tst2013.talkid1654_029 BUT WHAT MADE THE BIGGEST IMPRESSION ON ME THAT FIRST MEETING WAS THAT HE WAS SMART AND FUNNY AND HE LOOKS LIKE A FARM BOY 
tst2013.talkid1654_030 HE HAD THESE BIG CHEEKS THESE BIG APPLE CHEEKS AND THIS WHEAT BLOND HAIR AND HE SEEMED SO SWEET 
tst2013.talkid1654_031 ONE OF THE SMARTEST THINGS CONOR DID FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WAS TO CREATE THE ILLUSION THAT I WAS THE DOMINANT PARTNER IN THE RELATIONSHIP 
tst2013.talkid1654_032 HE DID THIS ESPECIALLY AT THE BEGINNING BY IDOLIZING ME 
tst2013.talkid1654_033 WE STARTED DATING AND HE LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT ME THAT I WAS SMART THAT I'M GOING TO HARVARD THAT I WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT HELPING TEENAGE GIRLS AND MY JOB 
tst2013.talkid1654_034 HE WANTED TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT MY FAMILY AND MY CHILDHOOD MY HOPES AND DREAMS 
tst2013.talkid1654_035 CONOR BELIEVED IN ME AS A WRITER AND A WOMAN IN A WAY THAT NO ONE ELSE EVER HAD 
tst2013.talkid1654_036 AND HE ALSO CREATED A MAGICAL ATMOSPHERE OF TRUST BETWEEN US BY CONFESSING HIS SECRET WHICH WAS THAT AS A VERY YOUNG BOY STARTING AT AGE FOR HE HAD BEEN SAVAGELY AND REPEATEDLY PHYSICALLY ABUSED BY HIS STEPFATHER AND THE ABUSIVE GOTTEN SO BAD THAT HE HAD TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL IN EIGHTH GRADE EVEN THOUGH HE WAS VERY SMART AND HE'D SPENT ALMOST TWENTY YEARS REBUILDING HIS LIFE 
tst2013.talkid1654_037 WHICH IS WHY THAT IVY LEAGUE DEGREE AND THE WALL STREET JOB AND HIS BRIGHT SHINY FUTURE MEANT SO MUCH TO HIM 
tst2013.talkid1654_038 IF YOU HAD TOLD ME THAT THIS SMART FUNNY SENSITIVE MAN WHO ADORED ME WOULD ONE DAY DICTATE WHETHER OR NOT I WORE MAKEUP HOW SHORT MY SKIRTS WERE WHERE I LIVED WHAT JOBS I TOOK WHO MY FRIENDS WERE AND WHERE I SPENT CHRISTMAS I WOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT YOU BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT A HINT OF VIOLENCE OR CONTROL OR ANGER IN CONOR AT THE BEGINNING 
tst2013.talkid1654_039 I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE FIRST STAGE IN ANY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RELATIONSHIP IS TO SEDUCE AND CHARM THE VICTIM 
tst2013.talkid1654_040 I ALSO DIDN 'T KNOW THAT THE SECOND STEP IS TO ISOLATE THE VICTIM 
tst2013.talkid1654_041 NOW CONOR DID NOT COME HOME ONE DAY AND ANNOUNCED HEY THAT ALL THIS ROMEO AND JULIET STUFF HAS BEEN GREAT BUT I NEED TO MOVE INTO THE NEXT PHASE WAY ISOLATE YOU AND I ABUSE YOU SO I NEED TO GET YOU OUT OF THIS APARTMENT WHERE THE NEIGHBORS CAN HEAR YOU SCREAM AND OUT OF THE CITY WHERE YOU HAVE FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND COWORKERS WHO CAN SEE THE BRUISES 
tst2013.talkid1654_042 INSTEAD CONOR CAME HOME ONE FRIDAY EVENING AND HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD QUIT HIS JOB THAT DAY HIS DREAM JOB AND HE SAID THAT HE HAD QUIT HIS JOB BECAUSE OF ME BECAUSE I HAD MADE HIM FEEL SO SAFE AND LOVED THAT HE DIDN'T NEED TO PROVE HIMSELF ON WALL STREET ANYMORE AND HE JUST WANTED TO GET OUT OF THE CITY AND AWAY FROM HIS ABUSIVE DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY AND MOVED TO A TINY TOWN IN NEW ENGLAND WHERE HE COULD START HIS LIFE OVER WITH ME BY HIS SIDE 
tst2013.talkid1654_043 NOW THE LAST THING I WANTED TO DO WAS LEAVE NEW YORK AND MY MY DREAM JOB BUT I THOUGHT YOU MADE SACRIFICES FOR YOUR SOULMATE SO I AGREED AND I QUIT MY JOB AND CONOR AND I LEFT MANHATTAN TOGETHER 
tst2013.talkid1654_044 I HAD NO IDEA I WAS FALLING INTO CRAZY LOVE THAT I WAS WALKING HEADFIRST INTO A CAREFULLY LAID PHYSICAL FINANCIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAP 
tst2013.talkid1654_045 THE NEXT STEP IN THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PATTERN IS TO INTRODUCE THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE AND SEE HOW SHE REACTS 
tst2013.talkid1654_046 AND HERE 'S WHERE THOSE GUNS COME IN 
tst2013.talkid1654_047 AS SOON AS WE MOVED TO NEW ENGLAND YOU KNOW THAT PLACE WHERE CONNOR WAS SUPPOSED TO FEEL SO SAFE HE BOUGHT THREE GUNS 
tst2013.talkid1654_048 HE KEPT ONE IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT OF OUR CAR 
tst2013.talkid1654_049 HE KEPT ONE UNDER THE PILLOWS ON OUR BED AND THE THIRD ONE HE KEPT IN HIS POCKET AT ALL TIMES 
tst2013.talkid1654_050 AND HE SAID THAT HE NEEDED THOSE GUNS BECAUSE OF THE TRAUMA HE 'D EXPERIENCED AS A YOUNG BOY 
tst2013.talkid1654_051 HE NEEDED THEM TO FEEL PROTECTED 
tst2013.talkid1654_052 BUT THOSE GUNS WERE REALLY A MESSAGE FOR ME AND EVEN THOUGH HE HADN'T RAISED A HAND TO ME MY LIFE WAS ALREADY IN GRAVE DANGER EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY 
tst2013.talkid1654_053 CONOR FIRST PHYSICALLY ATTACKED ME FIVE DAYS BEFORE A WEDDING 
tst2013.talkid1654_054 IT WAS SEVEN AM I STILL HAD ON MY NIGHTGOWN 
tst2013.talkid1654_055 I WAS WORKING ON MY COMPUTER TRYING TO FINISH FREELANCE WRITING ASSIGNMENT AND I GOT FRUSTRATED AND CONOR USED MY ANGER AS AN EXCUSE TO PUT BOTH OF HIS HANDS AROUND MY NECK AND TO SQUEEZE SO TIGHTLY THAT I COULD NOT BREATHE OR SCREAM AND HE USED THE CHOKEHOLD TO HIT MY HEAD REPEATEDLY AGAINST THE WALL 
tst2013.talkid1654_056 FIVE DAYS LATER THE TEN BRUISES ON MY NECK HAD JUST FADED AND I PUT ON MY MOTHER 'S WEDDING DRESS AND I MARRIED HIM 
tst2013.talkid1654_057 DESPITE WHAT HAD HAPPENED I WAS SURE WE WERE GOING TO LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER BECAUSE I LOVED HIM AND HE LOVED ME SO MUCH 
tst2013.talkid1654_058 AND HE WAS VERY VERY SORRY 
tst2013.talkid1654_059 HE HAD JUST BEEN REALLY STRESSED OUT BY THE WEDDING AND BY BECOMING A FAMILY WITH ME 
tst2013.talkid1654_060 IT WAS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT AND HE WAS NEVER GOING TO HURT ME AGAIN 
tst2013.talkid1654_061 IT HAPPENED TWICE MORE ON THE HONEYMOON 
tst2013.talkid1654_062 THE FIRST TIME I WAS DRIVING TO FIND A SECRET BEACH AND I GOT LOST AND HE PUNCHED ME IN THE SIDE OF MY HEAD SO HARD THAT THE OTHER SIDE OF MY HEAD REPEATEDLY HIT THE DRIVER SIDE WINDOW 
tst2013.talkid1654_063 AND THEN A FEW DAYS LATER DRIVING HOME FROM OUR HONEYMOON HE GOT FRUSTRATED BY TRAFFIC AND HE THREW A COLD BIG MAC IN MY FACE 
tst2013.talkid1654_064 CONOR PROCEEDED TO BEAT ME ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK FOR THE NEXT TWO AND A HALF YEARS OF OUR MARRIAGE 
tst2013.talkid1654_065 I WAS MISTAKEN AND THINKING THAT I WAS UNIQUE AND ALONE IN THIS SITUATION 
tst2013.talkid1654_066 ONE IN THREE AMERICAN WOMEN EXPERIENCES DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR STALKING AT SOME POINT IN HER LIFE AND THE CDC REPORTS THAT FIFTEEN MILLION CHILDREN ARE ABUSED EVERY YEAR FIFTEEN MILLION 
tst2013.talkid1654_067 SO ACTUALLY I WAS IN VERY GOOD COMPANY 
tst2013.talkid1654_068 BACK TO MY QUESTION WHY DID I STAY 
tst2013.talkid1654_069 THE ANSWER IS EASY 
tst2013.talkid1654_070 I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS ABUSING ME 
tst2013.talkid1654_071 EVEN THOUGH HE HELD THOSE LOADED GUNS TO MY HEAD PUSHED ME DOWN STAIRS THREATENED TO KILL OUR DOG PULLED THE KEY OUT OF THE CAR IGNITION AS I DROVE DOWN THE HIGHWAY POURED COFFEE GRINDS ON MY HEAD AS I DRESSED FOR A JOB INTERVIEW I NEVER ONCE THOUGHT OF MYSELF AS A BATTERED WIFE 
tst2013.talkid1654_072 INSTEAD I WAS A VERY STRONG WOMAN IN LOVE WITH A DEEPLY TROUBLED MAN AND I WAS THE ONLY PERSON ON EARTH WHO COULD HELP CONOR FACE HIS DEMONS 
tst2013.talkid1654_073 THE OTHER QUESTION EVERYBODY ASKS IS WHAT IS AND SHE JUST LEAVE 
tst2013.talkid1654_074 WHY DIDN'T I WALK OUT I COULD HAVE LEFT ANYTIME 
tst2013.talkid1654_075 TO ME THIS IS THE SADDEST AND MOST PAINFUL QUESTION THAT PEOPLE ASK BECAUSE WE VICTIMS KNOW SOMETHING YOU USUALLY DON'T IT 'S INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS TO LEAVE AN ABUSER 
tst2013.talkid1654_076 BECAUSE THE FINAL STEP IN THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PATTERN IS KILL HER 
tst2013.talkid1654_077 OVER SEVENTY PERCENT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MURDERS HAPPEN AFTER THE VICTIM HAS ENDED THE RELATIONSHIP AFTER SHE'S GOT NOW BECAUSE THEN THE ABUSER HAS NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE 
tst2013.talkid1654_078 OTHER OUTCOMES INCLUDE LONG TERM STALKING EVEN AFTER THE ABUSER REMARRIES DENIAL OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND MANIPULATION OF THE FAMILY COURT SYSTEM TO TERRIFY THE VICTIM AND HER CHILDREN WHO ARE REGULARLY FORCED BY FAMILY COURT JUDGES TO SPEND UNSUPERVISED TIME WITH THE MAN WHO BEAT THEIR MOTHER 
tst2013.talkid1654_079 AND STILL WE ASK WHY DOESN 'T SHE JUST LEAVE 
tst2013.talkid1654_080 I WAS ABLE TO LEAVE BECAUSE OF ONE FINAL SADISTIC BEATING THAT BROKE THROUGH MY DENIAL 
tst2013.talkid1654_081 I REALIZED THAT THE MAN WHO I LOVED SO MUCH WAS GOING TO KILL ME IF I LET HIM 
tst2013.talkid1654_082 SO I BROKE THE SILENCE 
tst2013.talkid1654_083 I TOLD EVERYONE THE POLICE MY NEIGHBORS MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY TOTAL STRANGERS AND I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE YOU ALL HELPED ME 
tst2013.talkid1654_084 WE TEND TO STEREOTYPE VICTIMS AS GRISLY HEADLINES SELF DESTRUCTIVE WOMEN DAMAGED GOODS 
tst2013.talkid1654_085 THE QUESTION WHY DOES SHE STAY 
tst2013.talkid1654_086 IS CODE FOR SOME PEOPLE FOR IT 'S HER FAULT FOR STAYING AS IF VICTIMS INTENTIONALLY CHOOSE TO FALL IN LOVE WITH MEN INTENT UPON DESTROYING US 
tst2013.talkid1654_087 BUT SINCE PUBLISHING CRAZY LOVE I HAVE HEARD HUNDREDS OF STORIES FOR MEN AND WOMEN WHO ALSO GOT OUT WHO LEARNED INVALUABLE LIFE LESSON FROM WHAT HAPPENED AND WHO REBUILT LIVES JOYOUS HAPPY LIVES AS EMPLOYEES WIVES AND MOTHERS LIVES COMPLETELY FREE OF VIOLENCE LIKE ME 
tst2013.talkid1654_088 IT TURNS OUT THAT I'M ACTUALLY A VERY TYPICAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM AND A TYPICAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVOR 
tst2013.talkid1654_089 I REMARRIED A KIND AND GENTLE MAN WE HAVE THOSE THREE KIDS 
tst2013.talkid1654_090 I HAVE THAT BLACK LAB AND I HAVE THAT MINIVAN 
tst2013.talkid1654_091 WHAT I WILL NEVER HAVE AGAIN EVER IS A LOAD GONE HELD TO MY HEAD BY SOMEONE WHO SAYS THAT HE LOVES ME 
tst2013.talkid1654_092 NOW RIGHT NOW MAYBE YOU'RE THINKING WOW THIS IS FASCINATING OR WOW HOW STUPID WISHING BUT THIS WHOLE TIME I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN TALKING ABOUT YOU 
tst2013.talkid1654_093 I PROMISE YOU THERE ARE SEVERAL PEOPLE LISTENING TO ME RIGHT NOW WHO ARE CURRENTLY BEING ABUSED OR WHO WERE ABUSES CHILDREN OR WHO ARE ABUSERS THEMSELVES 
tst2013.talkid1654_094 ABUSE COULD BE AFFECTING YOUR DAUGHTER YOUR SISTER YOUR BEST FRIEND RIGHT NOW 
tst2013.talkid1654_095 I WAS ABLE TO END MY OWN CRAZY LOVE STORY BY BREAKING THE SILENCE 
tst2013.talkid1654_096 I'M STILL BREAKING THE SILENCE TODAY 
tst2013.talkid1654_097 IT 'S MY WAY OF HELPING OTHER VICTIMS AND IT'S MY FINAL REQUEST OF YOU 
tst2013.talkid1654_098 TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU HEARD HERE 
tst2013.talkid1654_099 ABUSE THRIVES ONLY IN SILENCE 
tst2013.talkid1654_100 YOU HAVE THE POWER TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SIMPLY BY SHINING A SPOTLIGHT ON IT 
tst2013.talkid1654_101 WE VICTIMS NEED EVERYONE 
tst2013.talkid1654_102 WE NEED EVERY ONE OF YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE SECRETS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
tst2013.talkid1654_103 SHOW ABUSE THE LIGHT OF DAY BY TALKING ABOUT IT WITH YOUR CHILDREN YOUR COWORKERS YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY 
tst2013.talkid1654_104 RECAST SURVIVORS AS WONDERFUL LOVABLE PEOPLE WITH FULL FUTURES

tst2013.talkid1658_002 WE DO THIS LITTLE INTERROGATION WE MEET PEOPLE TO MAKE A MENTAL RESUME FOR THEM 
tst2013.talkid1658_003 WHAT 'S NAME WAY FROM 
tst2013.talkid1658_004 HOW OLD ARE YOU WHAT DO YOU DO 
tst2013.talkid1658_005 THEN WE GET MORE PERSONAL WITH IT 
tst2013.talkid1658_006 HAVE YOU EVER HAD ANY DISEASES

tst2013.talkid1658_009 WHAT DO YOU INTO WHO ARE YOU INTO 
tst2013.talkid1658_010 WHAT GENDER DO YOU LIKE TO SLEEP WITH 
tst2013.talkid1658_011 I GET IT 
tst2013.talkid1658_012 WE ARE NEUROLOGICALLY HARDWIRED TO SEEK OUT PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES 
tst2013.talkid1658_013 WE START FORMING CLIQUES AS SOON AS ARE OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT ACCEPTANCE FEELS LIKE 
tst2013.talkid1658_014 WE BOND TOGETHER BASED ON ANYTHING THAT WE CAN MUSIC PREFERENCE RACE GENDER THE BLOCK THAT WE GREW UP ON 
tst2013.talkid1658_015 WE SEEK OUT ENVIRONMENTS THAT REINFORCE OUR PERSONAL CHOICES 
tst2013.talkid1658_016 SOMETIMES THOUGH JUST THE QUESTION WHAT DO YOU DO 
tst2013.talkid1658_017 CAN FEEL LIKE SOMEBODY 'S OPENING A TINY LITTLE BOX ASKING YOU SQUEEZE YOURSELF INSIDE OF IT 
tst2013.talkid1658_018 BECAUSE THE CATEGORIES I FOUND ARE TO LIMITING 
tst2013.talkid1658_019 THE BOXES ARE TOO NARROW 
tst2013.talkid1658_020 AND THIS CAN GET REALLY DANGEROUS 
tst2013.talkid1658_021 SO HERE 'S A DISCLAIMER ABOUT ME THOUGH BEFORE WE GET TO DEEP INTO THIS 
tst2013.talkid1658_022 I GREW UP IN A VERY SHELTERED ENVIRONMENT 
tst2013.talkid1658_023 I WAS RAISED IN DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN IN THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES TO BLOCKS FROM THE EPICENTER OF PUNK MUSIC 
tst2013.talkid1658_024 I WAS SHIELDED FROM THE PAINS OF BIGOTRY AND THE SOCIAL RESTRICTIONS OF A RELIGIOUSLY BASED UPBRINGING 
tst2013.talkid1658_025 WHERE I COME FROM IF YOU WEREN'T A DRAG CLEAN A HORROR RADICAL THINKER OR PERFORMANCE ARTIST OF SOME KIND YOU WERE THE WEIRDO 
tst2013.talkid1658_026 IT WAS AN ORTHODOX OF BRINGING BUT AS A KID ON THE STREETS OF NEW YORK YOU LEARN HOW TO TRUST AND INSTINCTS YOU LEARN HOW TO GO WITH THEIR OWN IDEAS 
tst2013.talkid1658_027 SO WHEN I WAS SIX I DECIDED THAT I WANTED TO BE A BOY 
tst2013.talkid1658_028 I WENT TO SCHOOL AND THEY INTO KIDS WOULD LET ME PLAY BASKETBALL WITH THEM 
tst2013.talkid1658_029 THEY SAID THEY WOULD LIKE GIRLS PLAY 
tst2013.talkid1658_030 SO I WENT HOME AND SHAPED MY HEAD AND I CAME BACK NEXT AND I SAID I 'M ABLE 
tst2013.talkid1658_031 I MEAN WHO KNOWS RIGHT 
tst2013.talkid1658_032 WHEN YOU'RE SIX MAYBE YOU CAN DO THAT 
tst2013.talkid1658_033 I DIDN'T WANT ANYONE TO KNOW THAT I WAS A GIRL AND THEY DIDN'T 
tst2013.talkid1658_034 I KEPT UP THE CHARADE FOR EIGHT YEARS 
tst2013.talkid1658_035 SO THIS IS ME WHEN I WAS ELEVEN 
tst2013.talkid1658_036 I WAS PLAYING A KID NAMED WALTER IN A MOVIE CALLED JULIAN PO 
tst2013.talkid1658_037 I WAS A LITTLE STREET TOUGH THAT FOLLOWED CHRISTIAN SLATER AROUND AND BADGERED HIM 
tst2013.talkid1658_038 SEE I WAS ALSO A CHILD ACTOR WHICH DOUBLED UP THE LAYERS OF THE PERFORMANCE OF MY IDENTITY BECAUSE NO ONE KNEW THAT I WAS ACTUALLY A GIRL REALLY PLAYING A BOY 
tst2013.talkid1658_039 IN FACT NO ONE OF MY LIFE KNEW THAT I WAS A GIRL NOT MY TEACHERS SCHOOL NOW MY FRIENDS NOT THE DIRECTORS THAT I WORK WITH 
tst2013.talkid1658_040 KIDS WOULD OFTEN COME UP TO ME IN CLASS AND GOT ME BY THE THROW TO CHECK FOR ATOMS APPLE ARE GRABBED MY TRIP MY CRASH CHECK I WAS WORKING WITH 
tst2013.talkid1658_041 WHEN I GO TO THE BATHROOM I WOULD TURN MY SHOES AROUND IN THE STALLS THAT IT LOOKED LIKE I WAS PING STANDING UP 
tst2013.talkid1658_042 AT SLEEPOVERS I WOULD HAVE PANIC ATTACKS TRYING TO BREAK IT TO GIRLS THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO KISS ME WITHOUT OUTING MYSELF 
tst2013.talkid1658_043 IS WORTH MENTIONING THOUGH THAT I DIDN'T HAITI MY BODY OR MY GENITALIUM 
tst2013.talkid1658_044 I DIDN 'T FEEL LIKE I WAS IN THE WRONG BODY 
tst2013.talkid1658_045 I FELT LIKE I WAS PERFORMING THIS ELABORATE ACT 
tst2013.talkid1658_046 I WOULDN'T HAVE QUALIFIED AS TRENDS GENDER 
tst2013.talkid1658_047 IS MY FAMILY THOUGH HAD BEEN THE KIND OF PEOPLE TO BELIEVE IN THERAPY THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE DIAGNOSED ME AS SOMETHING LIKE GENDER DYSMORPHIC AND PUT ME ON HORMONES TO STAVE OFF PUBERTY 
tst2013.talkid1658_048 BUT IN MY PARTICULAR CASE I JUST WOKE UP ONE DAY WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN AND I DECIDED THAT I WANTED TO BE A GIRL AGAIN 
tst2013.talkid1658_049 BEAUTY IT HIT AND I HAD NO IDEA WHAT BEING A GIRL MEANT AND I WAS RIGHT READY TO FIGURE OUT WHO ACTUALLY WAS 
tst2013.talkid1658_050 WHEN A KID BEHAVES LIKE I DID THEY DON'T EXACTLY HAVE TO COME OUT 
tst2013.talkid1658_051 NO ONE IS EXACTLY SHOCKED 
tst2013.talkid1658_052 BUT I WAS ASKED TO DEFINE MYSELF BY MY PARENTS 
tst2013.talkid1658_053 WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN AND I CALLED MY FATHER TO TELL HIM THAT I HAD FALLEN IN LOVE IT WAS THE LAST THING ON EITHER OF OUR MINDS TO DISCUSS WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES WERE OF THE FACT THAT MY FIRST LOVES A GIRL 
tst2013.talkid1658_054 THREE YEARS LATER WHEN I FELL IN LOVE WITH A MAN NOW THEY'RE MY PARENTS BOUGHT AN EYELASH EITHER 
tst2013.talkid1658_055 SO IT 'S ONE OF THE GREAT BLESSINGS OF MY VERY UNORTHODOX CHILDHOOD THAT I WASN EVER ASKED TO DEFINE MYSELF AS ANYONE THING AT ANY POINT 
tst2013.talkid1658_056 I WAS JUST ALLOWED TO BE ME GOING TO ENGINE EVERY MOMENT 
tst2013.talkid1658_057 SO FOR ALMOST FIVE YEARS AGO PROPOSITION A AT THE GREAT MARRIAGE EQUALITY DEBATE WAS RAISING A LOT OF DUST AROUND THIS COUNTRY 
tst2013.talkid1658_058 AND AT THE TIME GETTING MARRIED WASN 'T REALLY SOMETHING I SPENT A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT 
tst2013.talkid1658_059 BUT I WAS STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT AMERICA A COUNTRY WITH SUCH A TARNISHED CIVIL RIGHTS RECORD COULD BE REPEATING ITS MISTAKES SO BLATANTLY 
tst2013.talkid1658_060 AND I REMEMBER WATCHING THE DISCUSSION ON TV AND THINKING HOW INTERESTING IT WAS THAT THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE WAS ESSENTIALLY DRAWING GEOGRAPHICAL BOUNDARIES THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY BETWEEN PLACES WHERE PEOPLE BELIEVED IN IT AND PLACES WHERE PEOPLE DIDN'T 
tst2013.talkid1658_061 AND THEN THAT THIS DISCUSSION WAS DRAWING GEOGRAPHICAL BOUNDARIES AROUND ME 
tst2013.talkid1658_062 IF THIS WAS A WATER WAS TWO DISPARATE SIDES I'VE BY DEFAULT FELL ON TEAM GAY BECAUSE I CERTAINLY WAS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT STRAIGHT 
tst2013.talkid1658_063 AT THE TIME I WAS JUST BEGINNING TO EMERGE FROM THIS EIGHT YEAR PERSONAL IDENTITY CRISIS ZIGZAG SAW ME GO FROM BEING A BOY TO BEING THIS AWKWARD GIRL THAT LOOKS LIKE A BOYS AND GIRLS CLOSE TO THE OPPOSITE EXTREME OF THIS SUPER SKIN BE OVER COMPENSATING BOY CHASING GIRLIE GIRL TO FINALLY JUST HAS AN EXPLORATION OF WHAT I ACTUALLY WAS A TOMBOYISH GIRL WHO LIKED BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS DEPENDING ON THE PERSON 
tst2013.talkid1658_064 I HAD SPENT A YEAR PHOTOGRAPHING THIS NEW GENERATION OF GIRLS MUCH LIKE MYSELF WHO FELL KIND OF BETWEEN THE LINES GIRLS WHO SKATEBOARDED BUT THEY DIDN'T LACEY UNDERWEAR GIRLS AND BOYS HAIR CUTS BUT WE'RE REALLY NAIL POLISH GIRLS WHO HAD EYESHADOW TO MATCH THEIR SCRAPED KNEES GIRLS WHO LIKED GIRLS AND BOYS WHO ALL LIKE BOYS AND GIRLS ARE ALL HATED BEING BOX INTO ANYTHING 
tst2013.talkid1658_065 I LOVE THESE PEOPLE AND I ADMIRED THEIR FREEDOM BUT I WATCHED AS THE WORLD OUTSIDE OF OUR UTOPIAN BUBBLE EXPLODED INTO THESE RAGING DEBATES WHERE PUNDITS STARTED LIKENING OUR LOVE TO BEAST YOU HALLIDAY ON NATIONAL TV 
tst2013.talkid1658_066 AND THIS POWERFUL AWARENESS ROLLED IN OVER ME THAT I WAS A MINORITY AND IN MY OWN HOME COUNTRY BASED ON ONE FACET OF MY CHARACTER 
tst2013.talkid1658_067 I WAS LEGALLY AND INDISPUTABLY A SECOND CLASS CITIZEN 
tst2013.talkid1658_068 I WAS AN ACTIVIST 
tst2013.talkid1658_069 I WOULD HAVE NO FLAGS IN MY OWN LIFE 
tst2013.talkid1658_070 BUT I WAS PLAYED BY THIS QUESTION HOW COULD ANYONE VOTE TO STRIP THE RIGHTS OF THE VAST VARIETY OF PEOPLE THAT I KNEW BASED ON ONE ELEMENT OF THEIR CHARACTER 
tst2013.talkid1658_071 HOW DID THEY SAY THAT WE AS A GROUP WERE NOT DESERVING OF EQUAL RIGHTS OF SOMEBODY ELSE 
tst2013.talkid1658_072 WHERE WE EVEN A GROUP WHAT GROUP 
tst2013.talkid1658_073 AND HAD THESE PEOPLE EVERYONE CONSCIOUSLY MET A VICTIM OF THEIR DISCRIMINATION 
tst2013.talkid1658_074 AND THEY KNOW THEY WERE VOTING AGAINST AND WHAT THE IMPACT WAS 
tst2013.talkid1658_075 AND THEN IT OCCURRED TO ME PERHAPS IF THEY COULD LOOK INTO THE EYES OF PEOPLE THAT THEY WERE CASTING INTO SECOND CLASS CITIZENSHIP IN MY MAKE IT HARDER FOR THEM TO DO 
tst2013.talkid1658_076 IT MIGHT GIVE THEM PAUSE 
tst2013.talkid1658_077 OBVIOUSLY I COULDN'T GET TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE THE SAME DINNER PARTY SO I FIGURED OUT A WAY WHERE I COULD INTRODUCE THEM TO EACH OTHER PHOTOGRAPHICALLY WITHOUT ANY ARTIFICE WITHOUT ANY LIGHTING ARE WITHOUT ANY MANIPULATION OF ANY KIND ON MY PART 
tst2013.talkid1658_078 BECAUSE IN A PHOTOGRAPH YOU CAN EXAMINE TO LIONS WHISKERS WITHOUT FEAR OF HIM RIPPING YOUR FACE 
tst2013.talkid1658_079 FOR ME PHOTOGRAPHY IS NOT JUST ABOUT EXPOSING FILM IT'S ABOUT EXPOSING THE VIEWER SOMETHING NEW A PLACE THEY HAVEN'T GONE BEFORE BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY TO PEOPLE THAT THEY MIGHT BE AFRAID OF 
tst2013.talkid1658_080 LIFE MAGAZINE INTRODUCED GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE TO DISTANT FAR OFF CULTURES THEY NEVER KNEW EXISTED THROUGH PICTURES 
tst2013.talkid1658_081 SO I DECIDED TO MAKE A SERIES OF VERY SIMPLE PORCH MUGSHOTS IF YOU WILL 
tst2013.talkid1658_082 I HAD BASICALLY DECIDED TO PHOTOGRAPH ANYONE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT WAS NOT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT STRAIGHT WHICH IF YOU DON'T KNOW AS A LIMITLESS PEOPLE 
tst2013.talkid1658_083 SO THIS IS A VERY LARGE UNDERTAKING AND TO DO IT WE NEEDED SOME HELP 
tst2013.talkid1658_084 SO I RAN OUT IN THE FREEZING COLD AND I PHOTOGRAPHED EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT I KNEW THAT I COULD GET TO IN FEBRUARY OF ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO 
tst2013.talkid1658_085 AND I TOOK THOSE PHOTOGRAPHS AND I WENT TO THE HRC AND I ASKED THEM FOR SOME HELP 
tst2013.talkid1658_086 AND THEY FUNDED TWO WEEKS OF SHOOTING IN NEW YORK 
tst2013.talkid1658_087 AND THEN WE MADE THIS 
tst2013.talkid1658_088 MY UNTIL IT RIGHT AND THEN ON THIS ONE 
tst2013.talkid1658_089 SELF EVIDENT CHOOSE A PHOTOGRAPHIC RECORD OF LGBTQ AMERICA TODAY 
tst2013.talkid1658_090 MY AIM IS TO TAKE A SIMPLE PORTRAIT OF ANYONE WHO 'S ANYTHING OTHER THAN ONE HUNDRED PERCENT STRAIGHT ARE PHYSICALLY FALLEN LGBTQ SPECTRUMS IN ANYWAY 
tst2013.talkid1658_091 MY GOAL IS TO SHOW THE HUMANITY THAT EXISTS IN EVERY ONE OF US THROUGH THE SIMPLICITY OF 
tst2013.talkid1658_092 YOU ALL THESE SHOES TO BE SELF EVIDENT THAT ALMANAC CREATED EQUAL 
tst2013.talkid1658_093 IT'S WRITTEN IN THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE 
tst2013.talkid1658_094 WE ARE FAILING AS A NATION TO UPHOLD THE MODELS UPON WHICH WE WERE FOUND IT 
tst2013.talkid1658_095 THERE IS NO QUALITY IN THE UNITED STATES 
tst2013.talkid1658_096 SO WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT 
tst2013.talkid1658_097 THE BY FOR EQUAL RIGHTS NOT JUST ABOUT GAY MARRIAGE 
tst2013.talkid1658_098 TODAY IN TWENTY NINE STATES MORE THAN HALF OF THIS COUNTRY YOU CAN LEGALLY BE FIRED JUST FOR YOUR SEXUALITY 
tst2013.talkid1658_099 I'VE HEARD HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE GIVE THE SAME ANSWER WE ARE ALL RESPOND 
tst2013.talkid1658_100 SO WHAT WE SHOT THREE HUNDRED FACES IN NEW YORK CITY 
tst2013.talkid1658_101 AND WE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO ANY OF THAT WAS JUST A GENEROUS SUPPORT OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN 
tst2013.talkid1658_102 I WANT TO TAKE THE PROJECT ACROSS THE COUNTRY 
tst2013.talkid1658_103 I WANT TO VISIT TWENTY FIVE AMERICAN CITIES AND ON THE SHOULD FOR FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE 
tst2013.talkid1658_104 THIS IS MY CONTRIBUTION TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS FIGHT OF MY GENERATION 
tst2013.talkid1658_105 I CHALLENGE YOU TO LOOK INTO THE FACES OF THESE PEOPLE AND TELL THEM WHAT THEY DESERVE LESS THAN ANY OTHER HUMAN BEINGS 
tst2013.talkid1658_106 ABSOLUTELY NOTHING COULD HAVE PREPARED US FOR WHAT HAPPENED TO HAVE 
tst2013.talkid1658_107 ALMOST EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE WATCH THAT VIDEO AND THEN THEY STARTED EMAILING US FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY ASKING US TO COME TO THEIR TOWNS AND HELP US TO HELP THEM TO SHOW THEIR FACES 
tst2013.talkid1658_108 AND A LOT MORE PEOPLE WANTED TO SHOW THEIR FACES THAT I HAD ANTICIPATED 
tst2013.talkid1658_109 SO I CHANGED MY IMMEDIATE GOAL TO TEN THOUSAND FACES 
tst2013.talkid1658_110 THAT VIDEO WAS MADE IN THE SPRING OF TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN AND AS OF TODAY I HAVE TRAVEL TO ALMOST TWENTY CITIES AND PHOTOGRAPHED ALMOST TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE 
tst2013.talkid1658_111 I KNOW THAT THIS IS A TALK BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A MINUTE OF JUST QUIET AND HAVE YOU JUST LOOK AT THESE FACES BECAUSE THERE 'S NOTHING THAT I CAN SAY THAT WILL ADD TO THEM 
tst2013.talkid1658_112 BECAUSE IF A PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS ON A PICTURE OF A FACE AND IT'S A WHOLE NEW VOCABULARY 
tst2013.talkid1658_113 SO AFTER TRAVELING AND TALKING TO PEOPLE IN PLACES LIKE OKLAHOMA OR SMALL TOWN TEXAS WE FOUND EVIDENCE THAT THE INITIAL PREMISE WAS DEAD ON 
tst2013.talkid1658_114 VISIBILITY REALLY IS KEY 
tst2013.talkid1658_115 FAMILIARITY REALLY IS THE GATEWAY DRUG TO EMPATHY 
tst2013.talkid1658_116 ONCE AN ISSUE POPS UP IN YOUR OWN BACKYARD OR MONKS DRONE FAMILY YOUR FAR MORE LIKELY TO EXPLORE SYMPATHY FOR DARK SPLENDOR PERSPECTIVE ON IT 
tst2013.talkid1658_117 OF COURSE IN MY TRAVELS I MET PEOPLE WHO LEGALLY DIVORCED THEIR CHILDREN FOR BEING OTHER THAN STRAIGHT BUT I ALSO MET PEOPLE WHO WERE SOUTHERN BAPTISTS WHO SWITCHED CHURCHES BECAUSE THEIR CHILD WAS A LESBIAN 
tst2013.talkid1658_118 SPARKING EMPATHY HAD BECOME THE BACKBONE OF SELF EVIDENT TRUTHS 
tst2013.talkid1658_119 BUT HERE 'S WHAT I WAS STARTING TO LEARN THAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING SELF EVIDENT TRUTHS DOESN 'T ERASE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN US 
tst2013.talkid1658_120 IN FACT ON THE CONTRARY IT HIGHLIGHTS THEM 
tst2013.talkid1658_121 IT PRESENTS NOT JUST THE COMPLEXITIES FOUND IN A PROCESSION OF DIFFERENT HUMAN BEINGS BUT THE COMPLEXITIES FOUND WITHIN EACH INDIVIDUAL PERSON 
tst2013.talkid1658_122 IT WASN'T THAT WE HAD TOO MANY BOXES IT WAS THAT WE HAD TOO FEW 
tst2013.talkid1658_123 AT SOME POINT I REALIZED THAT MY MISSION TO PHOTOGRAPH GAYS WAS INHERENTLY FLAWED BECAUSE THERE WERE A MILLION DIFFERENT SHADES OF GAY 
tst2013.talkid1658_124 HERE I WAS TRYING TO HELP AND I HAD TO PERPETUATE OF THE VERY THING I SPENT MY LIFE TRYING TO AVOID YET ANOTHER BOX 
tst2013.talkid1658_125 SOMETHING WHEN I ADDED A QUESTION TO THE RELEASE FORM THAT ASK PEOPLE TO QUANTIFY THEMSELVES ON A SCALE OF ONE TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT GAY 
tst2013.talkid1658_126 AND I WATCHED SO MANY EXISTENTIAL CRISIS UNFOLD IN FRONT OF 
tst2013.talkid1658_127 PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO BECAUSE THEY HAD NEVER BEEN PRESENTED WITH THE OPTION BEFORE 
tst2013.talkid1658_128 CAN YOU QUANTIFY OR OPENNESS 
tst2013.talkid1658_129 ONCE THEY GOT OVER THE SHOCK THOUGH BY AND LARGE PEOPLE OPTED FOR SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SEVENTY TO NINETY FIVE PERCENT OR THE THREE TO TWENTY PERCENT MARKS 
tst2013.talkid1658_130 OF COURSE THERE ARE LOTS OF PEOPLE OPTED FOR A ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ONE OF THE OTHER BUT I FOUND THAT A MUCH LARGER PROPORTION OF PEOPLE IDENTIFY TO SOMETHING THAT WAS MUCH MORE NUANCED 
tst2013.talkid1658_131 I FOUND THAT MOST PEOPLE FALL IN THE SPECTRUM OF WHAT I HAVE COME TO REFER TO AS GREY 
tst2013.talkid1658_132 LET ME BE CLEAR THOUGH AND THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT IN NO WAY I AM I SAYING THAT PREFERENCE DOESN 'T EXIST 
tst2013.talkid1658_133 AND I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF CHOICE VERSUS BIOLOGICAL IMPERATIVE BECAUSE IF ANY OF YOU HAPPEN TO BE OF THE BELIEF THAT SEXUAL ORIENTATION IS A CHOICE I INVITE YOU TO GO OUT AND TRY TO BE GREAT 
tst2013.talkid1658_134 TO TAKE A PICTURE JUST TRY 
tst2013.talkid1658_135 BUT I AM SAYING THOUGH IS THAT HUMAN BEINGS ARE NOT ONE DIMENSIONAL 
tst2013.talkid1658_136 THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO TAKE FROM THE PERCENTAGE SYSTEM IS THIS IF YOU HAVE GAY PEOPLE OVER HERE AND YOU HAVE STRAIGHT PEOPLE OVER HERE AND WHILE WE RECOGNIZE THAT MOST PEOPLE IDENTIFY A SOMEWHERE CLOSER TO ONE BINARY OR ANOTHER THERE IS THIS VAST SPECTRUM OF PEOPLE THAT EXIST IN BETWEEN 
tst2013.talkid1658_137 AND THE REALITY THAT THIS PRESENTS A COMPLICATED ONE 
tst2013.talkid1658_138 BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU PASS A LAW THAT ALLOWS A BOSS TO FIRE AN EMPLOYEE FOR HOMOSEXUAL BEHAVIOR WHERE EXACTLY DO YOU DRAW THE LINE 
tst2013.talkid1658_139 IS IT OVER HERE BY THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD ONE OR TWO HETEROSEXUAL EXPERIENCES SO FAR 
tst2013.talkid1658_140 OR IS IT OVER HERE ABOUT PEOPLE ONLY HAD ONE OR TWO HOMOSEXUAL EXPERIENCES THUS FAR 
tst2013.talkid1658_141 WHERE EXACTLY DOES ONE BECOME A SECOND CLASS CITIZEN 
tst2013.talkid1658_142 ANOTHER INTERESTING THING THAT I LEARNED FROM MY PROJECT IN MY TRAVELS IS JUST WHAT A POOR BINDING AGENT SEXUAL ORIENTATION IT 
tst2013.talkid1658_143 AFTER TRAVELING SO MUCH AND MEETING SO MANY PEOPLE LET ME TELL YOU THERE ARE JUST AS MANY JERKS AND SWEETHEARTS AND DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS AND JOCKS AND QUEENS AND EVERY OTHER POLARIZATION YOU CAN POSSIBLY THINK OF WITHIN THE LGBT COMMUNITY AS THERE ARE WITHIN THE HUMAN RACE 
tst2013.talkid1658_144 ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT WE PLAY WITH ONE LEGAL HAND TIED BEHIND OUR BACKS AND ONCE YOU GET PASSED A SHARED NARRATIVE OF PREJUDICE AND STRUGGLE JUST BEING OTHER THAN STRAIGHT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT WE HAVE ANYTHING IN COMMON 
tst2013.talkid1658_145 SO IN THE ENDLESS PROLIFERATION OF FACES THAT SELF EVIDENT TRUTHS IS ALWAYS BECOMING AS IT HOPEFULLY APPEARS ACROSS MORE AND MORE PLATFORMS BUS SHELTERS BILLBOARDS FACEBOOK PAGES SCREEN SAVERS PERHAPS AND WATCHING THIS PROCESSION OF HUMANITY SOMETHING INTERESTING AND USEFUL WILL BEGIN TO HAPPEN 
tst2013.talkid1658_146 HOPEFULLY THESE CATEGORIES THESE BINARIES THESE OVER SIMPLIFIED BOXES WILL BEGIN TO BECOME USELESS AND THE BEGIN TO FALL AWAY 
tst2013.talkid1658_147 BECAUSE REALLY THEY DESCRIBE NOTHING THAT WE SEE AND NO ONE THAT WE KNOW AND NOTHING THAT WE ARE 
tst2013.talkid1658_148 WHAT WE SEE ARE HUMAN BEINGS IN ALL THEIR MULTIPLICITY 
tst2013.talkid1658_149 AND SEEING THEM MAKES IT HARDER TO DENY THEIR HUMANITY 
tst2013.talkid1658_150 THE VERY LEAST I HOPE IT MAKES IT HARD TO DENY THE HUMAN RIGHTS 
tst2013.talkid1658_151 SO IS IT ME PARTICULARLY THAT YOU WOULD CHOOSE TO DENY THE RIGHT TO HOUSING THE RIGHT TO ADOPT CHILDREN THE RIGHT TO MARRIAGE THE FREEDOM TO SHOP HERE LIVE HERE BY HERE 
tst2013.talkid1658_152 MY THE ONE THAT YOU CHOOSE TO DISOWN AS YOUR CHILD OR YOUR BROTHER OR YOUR SISTER YOUR MOTHER YOUR FATHER YOUR NEIGHBOR YOUR COUSIN YOUR UNCLE THE PRESIDENT YOUR POLICEWOMAN OR THE FIREMEN 
tst2013.talkid1658_153 IT 'S TOO LATE 
tst2013.talkid1658_154 BECAUSE I ALREADY AM ALL OF THOSE THINGS 
tst2013.talkid1658_155 WE ALREADY ARE ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND WE ALWAYS HAVE BEEN 
tst2013.talkid1658_156 SO PLEASE DON'T GREENHOUSES STRANGERS PENISES YOUR FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS PERIOD 
tst2013.talkid1658_157 THANK YOU 
tst2013.talkid1659_000 I HAVE NEVER EVER FORGOTTEN THE WORDS OF MY GRANDMOTHER WHO DIED AND HER EXILE SUN RESISTS GADDAFI FIGHT HIM 
tst2013.talkid1659_001 BUT DON'T YOU EVER TURN INTO I GET THEIR FEEL LIKE REVOLUTIONARY 
tst2013.talkid1659_002 ALMOST TWO YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THE LIBYAN REVOLUTION BROKE OUT INSPIRED BY THE WAVES OF MASS MOBILIZATION IN BOTH THE TUNISIAN AND THE EGYPTIAN REVOLUTION 
tst2013.talkid1659_003 I JOINED FORCES WITH MANY OTHER LIBYANS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE LIBYA TO CALL FOR A DAY OF RAGE AND TO INITIATE A REVOLUTION AGAINST THE TYRANNICAL REGIME OF GADDAFI 
tst2013.talkid1659_004 AND THERE IT WAS A GREAT REVOLUTION 
tst2013.talkid1659_005 YOUNG LIBYAN WOMEN AND MEN WERE AT THE FOREFRONT CALLING FOR THE FALL OF THE REGIME RAISING SLOGANS ARV FREEDOM DIGNITY SOCIAL JUSTICE 
tst2013.talkid1659_006 THEY HAVE SHOWN AND EXAMPLE EVERY BRAVERY IN CONFRONTING THE BRUTAL DICTATORSHIP OF GADDAFI 
tst2013.talkid1659_007 THEY HAVE SHOWN A GREAT SENSE OF SOLIDARITY FROM FAR EAST OF THE FAR WEST TO THE SOUTH 
tst2013.talkid1659_008 EVENTUALLY AFTER A PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS OF BRUTAL WAR AND A TOLL RATE OF ALMOST FIFTY THOUSAND DEAD WE MANAGED TO LIBERATE OUR COUNTRY AND TO THE TOPPLE THE TYRANT 
tst2013.talkid1659_009 HOWEVER GADDAFI LEFT BEHIND HEAVY BURDEN A LEGACY OF TYRANNY CORRUPTION AND SEEDS OF DIVERGENCE 
tst2013.talkid1659_010 FOR FOUR DECADES GIVE THAT THESE TYRANNICAL REGIME DESTROYED THE INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL AS THE CULTURE AND THE MORAL FABRIC OF LIBYAN SOCIETY 
tst2013.talkid1659_011 AWARE OF THE DEVASTATION AND THE CHALLENGES I WAS KEEN AMONG MANY OTHER WOMEN TO REBUILD THE LIBYAN CIVIL SOCIETY CALLING FOR INCLUSIVE AND JUST TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY AND NATIONAL RECONCILIATION 
tst2013.talkid1659_012 ALMOST TWO HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS WERE ESTABLISHED IN BENGHAZI DURING AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FALL OF GADDAFI ALMOST THREE HUNDRED IN TRIPOLI 
tst2013.talkid1659_013 AFTER A PERIOD OF THIRTY THREE YEARS IN EXILE I WENT BACK TO LIBYA AND WITH UNIQUE ENTHUSIASM I STARTED ORGANIZING WORKSHOPS ON CAPACITY BUILDING ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT OF LEADERSHIP SKILLS 
tst2013.talkid1659_014 WITH AMAZING GROUP OF WOMAN I COFOUNDED THE LIBYAN WOMEN 'S PLATFORM FOR PEACE OUR MOVEMENT OF WOMEN LEADERS FROM DIFFERENT WALKS OF LIFE TO LOBBY FOR THE SOCIAL POLITICAL EMPOWERMENT OF WOMEN AND TO LOBBY FOR OUR RIGHT FOR EQUAL PARTICIPATION IN BUILDING DEMOCRACY AND PEACE 
tst2013.talkid1659_015 IMAGE A VERY DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT IN THE PRE ELECTIONS AND ENVIRONMENT WHICH WAS INCREASINGLY POLARIZED AND ENVIRONMENT WHICH WAS SHAPED BY THE SELFISH POLITICS OF DOMINANCE AND EXCLUSION 
tst2013.talkid1659_016 I LED AN INITIATIVE BY THE LIBYAN WOMEN 'S PLATFORM FOR PEACE TO LOBBY FOR A MORE INCLUSIVE ELECTORAL LAW A LAW THAT WOULD GIVE EVERY CITIZEN NO MATTER WHAT YOUR BACKGROUND THE RIGHT TO VOTE AND RUN AND MOST IMPORTANTLY TO STIPULATE ON POLITICAL PARTIES THE ALTERNATION OF MALE AND FEMALE CANDIDATES VERTICALLY AND HORIZONTALLY IN THEIR LISTS CREATING ZIPPER LISTS 
tst2013.talkid1659_017 EVENTUALLY OUR INITIATIVE WAS ADOPTED AND SUCCESSFUL 
tst2013.talkid1659_018 WOMAN ONE SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE PERCENT OF THE NATIONAL CONGRESS IN THE FIRST ELECTIONS EVER IN FIFTY TWO YEARS 
tst2013.talkid1659_019 HOWEVER BIT BY BIT EUPHORIA OF THE ELECTIONS AND OF THE REVOLUTION AS A WHOLE WAS FEEDING OUT FOR EVERY DAY WE WERE WAKING UP ON THE NEWS OF VIOLENCE 
tst2013.talkid1659_020 ONE DAY WE WAKE UP IN THE NEWS OF THE DESECRATION OF ANCIENT MOSQUES AND SUFI TOMBS 
tst2013.talkid1659_021 ON ANOTHER DAY WE WAKE UP IN THE NEWS OF THE MURDER OF THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR AND THE ATTACK ON THE CONSULATE 
tst2013.talkid1659_022 ON ANOTHER DAY WE WAKE UP ON THE NEWS OF THE ASSASSINATION OF ARMY OFFICERS 
tst2013.talkid1659_023 AND EVERY DAY EVERY DAY WE WAKE UP WITH THE RULE OF THE MILITIAS AND THEIR CONTINUOUS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS OF PRISONERS AND THEIR DISRESPECT OF THE RULE OF LAW 
tst2013.talkid1659_024 OUR SOCIETY SHAPED BY A REVOLUTIONARY MINDSET BECAME MORE POLARIZED AND HAS DRIVEN AWAY FROM THE IDEALS AND THE PRINCIPLES FREEDOM DIGNITY SOCIAL JUSTICE THAT WE FIRST HELD 
tst2013.talkid1659_025 INTOLERANCE EXCLUSION AND REVENGE BECAME THE ICONS OF THE POST MATH OF THE REVOLUTION 
tst2013.talkid1659_026 I AM HERE TODAY NOT AT ALL TO INSPIRE YOU WITH OUR SUCCESS STORY OF THE ZIPPER LESS THAN THE ELECTIONS 
tst2013.talkid1659_027 I'M RATHER HERE TODAY TO CONFESS THAT WE AS A NATION TOOK THE WRONG CHOICE MADE THE WRONG DECISION 
tst2013.talkid1659_028 WE DID NOT PRIORITIZE RIGHT 
tst2013.talkid1659_029 FOR ELECTIONS DID NOT BRING PEACE AND STABILITY AND SECURITY IN LIBYA 
tst2013.talkid1659_030 DID ZIPPER LIST AND THE ALTERNATION BETWEEN FEMALE AND MALE CANDIDATES BRING PEACE AND NATIONAL RECONCILIATION 
tst2013.talkid1659_031 NO IT DID 
tst2013.talkid1659_032 WHAT IS EVENT 
tst2013.talkid1659_033 WHY DOES OUR SOCIETY CONTINUE TO BE POLARIZED AND DOMINATED WITH SELFISH POLITICS OF DOMINANCE AND EXCLUSION BY BOTH MEN AND WOMEN 
tst2013.talkid1659_034 MAYBE WHAT 'S MISSING WERE NOT THE WOMAN ONLY BUT THE FEMININE VALUES OF COMPASSION MERCY AND INCLUSION 
tst2013.talkid1659_035 OUR SOCIETY NEED NATIONAL DIALOGUE A CONSENSUS BUILDING MORE THAN IT NEEDED THE ELECTIONS WHICH ONLY REINFORCE POLARIZATION DIVIDED 
tst2013.talkid1659_036 OUR SOCIETY NEEDS THE QUALITATIVE REPRESENTATION OF THE FEMININE MORE THAN IT NEEDS THE NUMEROUS COOL QUANTITATIVE REPRESENTATION OF THE FEMININE 
tst2013.talkid1659_037 WE NEED TO STOP ACTING AS AGENTS OF RAGE AND CALLING FOR DAYS OF RAGE 
tst2013.talkid1659_038 WE NEED TO START ACTING AS AGENTS OF COMPASSION AND MERCY 
tst2013.talkid1659_039 WE NEED TO DEVELOP A DISK FEMININE DISCOURSE THAT NOT ONLY HONORS BUT ALSO IMPLEMENTS MERCY INSTEAD OF REVENGE COLLABORATION INSTEAD OF COMPETITION INCLUSION INSTEAD OF EXCLUSION 
tst2013.talkid1659_040 THESE ARE THE IDEALS THAT A WAR TORN LIBYA NEEDS DESPERATELY IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE PEACE 
tst2013.talkid1659_041 FOR PEACE HAS AN ALCHEMY AND THIS ALCHEMY IS ABOUT THE INTERTWINING THE ALTERNATION BETWEEN THE FEMININE AND MASCULINE PERSPECTIVE 
tst2013.talkid1659_042 THAT 'S THE REAL ZIPPER 
tst2013.talkid1659_043 AND WE NEED TO ESTABLISH THAT EXISTENTIALLY BEFORE WE DO SOURCE YOU POLITICALLY 
tst2013.talkid1659_044 ACCORDING TO A KORAN ADVERSE SAM PEACE IS THE WORD OF ALL MERCIFUL GOD REGIME 
tst2013.talkid1659_045 IN TURN THE WORD RAHIM WHICH IS KNOWN IN ALL ABRAHAMIC TRADITIONS HAS THE SAME ROOT IN ARABIC AS THE WORD RAHEM WOMB SYMBOLIZING THE MATERNAL FEMININE ENCOMPASSING ALL HUMANITY FROM WHICH THE MALE AND THE FEMALE FROM WHICH ALL TRIBES ALL PEOPLES HAVE EMANATED FROM 
tst2013.talkid1659_046 AND SO JUST AS THE WOMB ENTIRELY ENVELOPES THE AMBER YOUR WHICH GROWS WITHIN IT THE DIVINE MATRIX OF COMPASSION NOR SHE'S THE ENTIRE EXISTENCE 
tst2013.talkid1659_047 THE US WE ARE TOLD THAT MY MERCY ENCOMPASSES OF THINGS 
tst2013.talkid1659_048 THUS WE ARE TOLD THAT MY MERCY TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER MY ANGER 
tst2013.talkid1659_049 MAY WE ALL BE GRANTED A GRACE OF MERCY 
tst2013.talkid1659_050 
tst2013.talkid1665_000 YOU PROBABLY ALL AGREE WITH ME THIS IS A VERY NICE WORLD 
tst2013.talkid1665_001 IT'S MADE OF ASPHALT AND THAT'S WHERE THERE'S A VERY NICE MATERIAL TO LIVE ON BUT NOT ALWAYS ESPECIALLY NOT ON THESE DAYS US TODAY AND IT'S RAINING A LOT 
tst2013.talkid1665_002 THEN YOU CAN HAVE A LOT OF SPLASH WATER AND THE ASPHALT 
tst2013.talkid1665_003 AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU THEN WHY IT WITH YOUR BICYCLE AND PAST IS GAS THAT 'S NOT VERY NICE 
tst2013.talkid1665_004 ALSO ASPHALT CAN CREATE A LOT OF NOISE 
tst2013.talkid1665_005 IT 'S A NOISY MATERIAL AND IF WE PRODUCE ROADS LIKE IN THE NETHERLANDS VERY CLOSE TO CITIES LIKE A SILENT ROAD 
tst2013.talkid1665_006 THE SOLUTION FOR THAT IS TO MAKE THEIR ROADS OPPOSE ASPHALT 
tst2013.talkid1665_007 SUPPOSE ASPHALT MATERIAL THAT WE USE NOW IN THE MOST OF THE HIGHWAYS IN NETHERLANDS IT HAS PORES AND WHAT I CAN JUST WENT THROUGH IT SO ALL THE RAINWATER WILL FLOW AWAY TO THE SIDE AND YOU HAVE A ROAD EASY SURVIVAL NO SPLASH WATER ANYMORE 
tst2013.talkid1665_008 ALSO THE NOISE WILL DISAPPEAR IN THESE PORES 
tst2013.talkid1665_009 BECAUSE IT 'S VERY HOLLOW ALL THE NOISE WILL DISAPPEAR SILENCE WORLD 
tst2013.talkid1665_010 IT ALSO HAS DISADVANTAGES OF COURSE AND THIS ADVANTAGE OF THIS ROAD IS THAT REVELING CAN OCCUR 
tst2013.talkid1665_011 WHAT THIS REVELING YOU SEE THAT IN THIS ROAD THAT THE STONES AT THE SURFACE COME OFF 
tst2013.talkid1665_012 FIRST YOU GET ONE STONE THEN SEVERAL MORE AND MORE AND MORE AND MORE AND MORE AND THEN I WILL NOT DO THAT 
tst2013.talkid1665_013 BUT THEY CAN DAMAGE WINDSHIELD SO THEY'RE NOT HAPPY WITH THAT 
tst2013.talkid1665_014 AND FINALLY THIS REVELING CAN ALSO NEED TO MORE AND MORE DAMAGE 
tst2013.talkid1665_015 SOMETIMES YOU CAN CREATE POTHOLES WITHOUT 
tst2013.talkid1665_016 ISRAEL 
tst2013.talkid1665_017 BOTTLES OF COURSE THAT CAN BECOME APOLLO WHAT WE HAVE A SOLUTION 
tst2013.talkid1665_018 HERE YOU SEE ACTUALLY HOW THE DAMAGE APPEARS IN THIS MATERIAL 
tst2013.talkid1665_019 IT 'S OPPOSE ASPHALT LIKE I SAID SO HAVE ONLY A SMALL AMOUNT OF BINDER BETWEEN THE STONES 
tst2013.talkid1665_020 DUE TO WEATHERING DUE TO UV LIGHT INTO OXIDATION THIS BINDER THIS BITUMEN THE GLUE BETWEEN THE AGGREGATES IS GOING TO SHRINK AND IF IT'S RINGS GET MICRO CRACKS AND THE DEAL EMANATE FROM THE AGGREGATES 
tst2013.talkid1665_021 AND THEN IF YOU DRIVE OVER THE ROAD YOU TAKE OUT THE AGGREGATES FOR YOU JUST SAW HERE 
tst2013.talkid1665_022 TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM SORT OF SELF FEELING MATERIALS 
tst2013.talkid1665_023 IF WE CAN MAKE THIS MATERIAL SELF HEALING THAN PROBABLY WE HAVE A SOLUTION 
tst2013.talkid1665_024 SO WHAT WE CAN DO IS USES STILL WILL JUST TO CLEAN BANDS STILL WILL WE CAN COTTON VERY SMALL PIECES AND THESE FAIRLY SMALL PIECES WE CAN NEXT TO THE PICTURE 
tst2013.talkid1665_025 SO THEN YOU HAVE ASPHALT THAT FAMILY SMALL PIECES OF STILL LIVE 
tst2013.talkid1665_026 THEN YOU NEED THE MACHINE LIKE YOU SEE HERE THAT YOU CAN USE FOR COOKING INDUCTION MACHINE 
tst2013.talkid1665_027 INDUCTION CAN HEAT ESPECIALLY STEEL VERY GOOD THAN THAT 
tst2013.talkid1665_028 THEN WHAT YOU DO IS YOU HEAT UP THE STEEL YOU MELTED BENJAMIN AND THE BITUMEN WILL FLOW INTO THESE MICRO CRACKS AND THE STONES AGAIN FIXED TO THE SURFACE 
tst2013.talkid1665_029 TODAY I WAS A MICROWAVE BECAUSE I CANNOT TAKE THE BIG INDUCTION MACHINE HERE ON THE STAGE 
tst2013.talkid1665_030 SO I MICROWAVE IS THE SIMILAR SYSTEM 
tst2013.talkid1665_031 SO I PUT SPECIMEN IN WHICH I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE OUT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED 
tst2013.talkid1665_032 SO THIS IS THE SPECIMEN COMING OUT NOW 
tst2013.talkid1665_033 SO I SAID WE HAVE WE HAVE SUCH AN INDUSTRIAL MACHINE IN THE LAB TO HEAT UP THE SPECIMENS 
tst2013.talkid1665_034 WE TESTED A LOT OF SPECIMENS THERE AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT THEY ACTUALLY SAW OUR RESULTS AND THIS OLD WELL THAT'S VERY INTERESTING WE HAVE TO TRY THEM 
tst2013.talkid1665_035 SO THEY DONATED TOSS A PIECE OF HIGHWAY FORMAL METERS OF A FIFTY AID WHERE WE HAVE TO MAKE A TEST TRACK TO TEST THIS MATERIAL 
tst2013.talkid1665_036 SO THAT'S WHAT WE DID HERE YOU SEE WHERE WE WERE MAKING THE TEST ROAD AND THEN OF COURSE THIS ROAD WILL LAST SEVERAL YEARS WITHOUT ANY DAMAGE THAT 'S WHAT WE KNOW FROM PRACTICE 
tst2013.talkid1665_037 SO WE TOOK A LOT OF SAMPLES FROM THIS ROAD AND WE TESTED THEM IN THE LAB 
tst2013.talkid1665_038 SO WE DID AGING ON THE SAMPLES DID A LOT OF LOADING ON IT HEALED THEM WITH OUR INDUCTION MACHINE HEALED THEM AND TEST THEM AGAIN 
tst2013.talkid1665_039 SEVERAL TIMES WE CAN REPEAT THAT 
tst2013.talkid1665_040 SO ACTUALLY THE CONCLUSION FROM THIS RESEARCH IS THAT IF WE GO ON THE ROAD EVERY FOUR YEARS LITTLE HEALING MACHINE THIS IS THE BIG VERSION WE HAVE MADE TO GO IN THE REAL WORLD IF YOU GO IN THE ROAD EVERY FOUR YEARS WE CAN DOUBLE THE SURFACE LIFE OF THIS ROAD WHICH OF COURSE SAVES A LOT OF MONEY 
tst2013.talkid1665_041 WELL TO CONCLUDE I CAN SAY THAT WE MADE A MATERIAL USING STEEL FIBERS EDITION OF STEEL FIBERS USING INDUCTION ENERGY TO REALLY INCREASE THE SERVICE LIFE OF THE ROAD DOUBLE THE SURFACE LIFE YOU CAN EVEN WHO REALLY SAVE A LOT OF MONEY WITH VERY SIMPLE TRICKS 
tst2013.talkid1665_042 AND NOW YOU OF COURSE CURIOUS IF IT ALSO GROWTH 
tst2013.talkid1665_043 SO WE STILL HAVE THE SPECIMEN HERE IT'S QUITE WARM 
tst2013.talkid1665_044 ACTUALLY STILL HAS TO COOL DOWN FIRST BEFORE I CAN SHOW YOU THAT FEELING WORKS 
tst2013.talkid1665_045 WHAT I CALL THE WORTHWHILE 
tst2013.talkid1665_046 LET 'S SEE THE IT WOULD 
tst2013.talkid1665_047 THANK YOU 
tst2013.talkid1666_000 WHEN I WAS ELEVEN I REMEMBER WAKING UP ONE MORNING TO THE SOUND OF JOY IN MY HOUSE 
tst2013.talkid1666_001 MY FATHER WAS LISTENING TO BBC NEWS ON HIS A SMALL GRAY RADIO 
tst2013.talkid1666_002 THERE WAS A BIG SMILE ON HIS FACE WHICH WAS UNUSUAL THEN BECAUSE THE NEWS MOSTLY DEPRESSED HIM 
tst2013.talkid1666_003 THE TALIBAN ARE GONE MY FATHER SHOUT IT 
tst2013.talkid1666_004 I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANT BUT I COULD SEE THAT MY FATHER WAS VERY VERY HAPPY 
tst2013.talkid1666_005 YOU CAN GO TO A REAL SCHOOL NOW HE SAID 
tst2013.talkid1666_006 MORNING THAT I WILL NEVER FORGET 
tst2013.talkid1666_007 REAL SCHOOL 
tst2013.talkid1666_008 YOU SEE I WAS SIX ONE TALIBAN TOOK OVER AFGHANISTAN AND MADE ILLEGAL FOR GIRLS TO GO TO SCHOOL 
tst2013.talkid1666_009 SO FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS I DRESSED AS A BOY TO 'S GOOD MY OLDER SISTER WHO WAS NO LONGER ALLOWED TO BE OUTSIDE ALONE TO A SECRET SCHOOL 
tst2013.talkid1666_010 IT WAS THE ONLY WAY WE BOTH COULD BE EDUCATED 
tst2013.talkid1666_011 EACH DAY WE TOOK A DIFFERENT ROUTE TO THAT NO ONE WOULD SUSPECT WHERE WE WERE GOING 
tst2013.talkid1666_012 WE WOULD COVER OUR BOOKS AND GROCERY BAGS SO IT WOULD SEEM WERE JUST OUT SHOPPING 
tst2013.talkid1666_013 THE SCHOOL WAS IN A HOUSE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED OF US PACKED IN ONE SMALL LIVING ROOM 
tst2013.talkid1666_014 IT WAS COZY IN WINTER BUT EXTREMELY HOT SUMMER 
tst2013.talkid1666_015 WE ALL KNEW WE WERE RISKING OUR LIVES THE TEACHER THE STUDENTS AND OUR PARENTS 
tst2013.talkid1666_016 FROM TIME TO TIME SCHOOL WOULD SUDDENLY BE CANCELLED FOR A WEEK BIGGEST TALIBAN WERE SUSPICIOUS 
tst2013.talkid1666_017 WE ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT THE NEW ABOUT US 
tst2013.talkid1666_018 WHERE WE BEING FOLLOWED 
tst2013.talkid1666_019 DO YOU KNOW WHERE WE LIVE 
tst2013.talkid1666_020 WE WERE SCARED BUT STILL SCHOOL WAS WHERE YOU WANT TO BE 
tst2013.talkid1666_021 I WAS VERY LUCKY TO GROW UP IN A FAMILY WHERE EDUCATION WAS PRIZED AND DAUGHTERS ARE TREASURE 
tst2013.talkid1666_022 MY GRANDFATHER WAS EXTRAORDINARY MAN FOR HIS TIME 
tst2013.talkid1666_023 A TOTAL MAVERICK FROM REMOTE PROVINCE OF AFGHANISTAN HE INSISTED THAT HIS DAUGHTER MY MOM AND GO TO SCHOOL AND FOR THAT HE WAS DOES OWNED BY HIS FATHER 
tst2013.talkid1666_024 BUT MY EDUCATED MOTHER BECAME A TEACHER 
tst2013.talkid1666_025 THERE 'S YEARS 
tst2013.talkid1666_026 SHE RETIRED TWO YEARS AGO ONLY DETERMINE OUR HOUSE INTO A SCHOOL FOR GIRLS AND WOMEN IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD 
tst2013.talkid1666_027 AND MY FATHER THAT 'S HIM HE WAS THE FIRST EVER AND HIS FAMILY TO RECEIVE EDUCATION 
tst2013.talkid1666_028 THERE WAS NO QUESTION THAT HIS CHILDREN WILL RECEIVE AN EDUCATION INCLUDING HIS DAUGHTERS DESPITE THE TALIBAN DESPITE THE RISKS 
tst2013.talkid1666_029 TO ONE THERE WAS GREATER RISK AND NOT EDUCATING HIS CHILDREN 
tst2013.talkid1666_030 DURING TALIBAN YEARS I REMEMBER THERE ARE TIMES I WOULD GET SO FRUSTRATED BY OUR LIFE AND ALWAYS BEING SCARED AND NOT SEEING A FUTURE 
tst2013.talkid1666_031 I WOULD WANT TO QUIT BUT MY FATHER HE WOULD SAY LISTEN MY DAUGHTER YOU CAN LOSE EVERYTHING YOU OWN IN YOUR LIFE 
tst2013.talkid1666_032 YOU ARE MONEY CAN BE STOLEN YOU CAN BE FORCED TO LEAVE YOUR HOME DURING A WAR 
tst2013.talkid1666_033 BUT THE ONE THING THERE WILL ALWAYS REMAIN WITH YOU IS WHAT IS HERE AND IF WE HAVE TO SELL OUR BLOOD TO PAY YOUR SCHOOL FEES WE WILL 
tst2013.talkid1666_034 SO YOU STILL NOT WANT TO CONTINUE 
tst2013.talkid1666_035 TODAY I'M TWENTY TWO 
tst2013.talkid1666_036 I WAS RAISING A COUNTRY THAT HAS BEEN DESTROYED BY DECADES OF WAR 
tst2013.talkid1666_037 FEWER THAN SIX PERCENT OF WOMEN MY AGE HAVE MADE IT BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL AND HAD MY FAMILY NOT BEEN SO COMMITTED TO MY EDUCATION I WOULD BE ONE OF THEM 
tst2013.talkid1666_038 INSTEAD I STAND HERE A PROUD GRADUATE OF MIDDLE BREAK COLLEGE 
tst2013.talkid1666_039 WHEN I RETURNED TO AFGHANISTAN MY GRANDFATHER THAT ONE EXILED FROM HIS HOME FOR DARING TO EDUCATE HISTORY DAUGHTERS WAS AMONG THE FIRST TO CONGRATULATE ME 
tst2013.talkid1666_040 NOT ONLY BRAGS ABOUT MY COLLEGE DEGREE BUT ALSO THAT I WAS THE FIRST WOMAN AND THAT I AM THE FIRST WOMAN TO DRIVE HIM THROUGH THE STREETS OF KABUL 
tst2013.talkid1666_041 MY FAMILY BELIEVES IN ME 
tst2013.talkid1666_042 I DREAM BIG BUT MY FAMILY DREAMS EVEN BIGGER FOR ME 
tst2013.talkid1666_043 THAT 'S WHY I'M A GLOBAL AMBASSADOR FOR TEN TIMES TEN A GLOBAL CAMPAIGN TO EDUCATE WOMEN 
tst2013.talkid1666_044 THAT 'S WHY I COFOUNDED SOLA THE FIRST AND PERHAPS ONLY BOARDING SCHOOL FOR GIRLS IN AFGHANISTAN A COUNTRY WHERE IT 'S STILL RISKY FOR GIRLS TO GO TO SCHOOL 
tst2013.talkid1666_045 THE EXCITING THING IS THAT I SEE STUDENTS AND MY SCHOOL WITH AMBITION GRABBING AT OPPORTUNITY 
tst2013.talkid1666_046 AND I SEE THEIR PARENTS AND THEIR FATHERS WHO LIKE MY OWN ADVOCATE FOR THEM DESPITE IN EVEN IN THE FACE OF STANDING OPPOSITION 
tst2013.talkid1666_047 LIKE AHMED THAT'S NOT HIS REAL NAME AND I CANNOT SHOW YOU HIS FACE BUT AHMED IS THE FATHER OF ONE OF MY STUDENTS 
tst2013.talkid1666_048 LESS THAN A MONTH AGO HE AND HIS DAUGHTER WERE ON THEIR WAY FROM SOLAR TO THEIR VILLAGE AND THEY LITERALLY MISSED BEING KILLED BY ROADSIDE BOMBS MY MINUTES 
tst2013.talkid1666_049 AS HE ARRIVED HOME THE PHONE RANG A VOICE WARNING HIM THAT IF HE SENT HIS DAUGHTER BACK TO SCHOOL THEY WERE TRY AGAIN 
tst2013.talkid1666_050 KILL ME NOW IF YOU WISH HE SAID BUT I WILL NOT RUN MY DAUGHTERS FUTURE BECAUSE OF YOUR OLD AND BACKWARD IDEAS 
tst2013.talkid1666_051 WHAT I'VE COME TO REALIZE ABOUT AFGHANISTAN AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS OFTEN DISMISSED IN THE WEST THAT BEHIND MOST MOST OF US WHO SUCCEED IS A FATHER WHO RECOGNIZES THE VALUE AND HIS DAUGHTER AND WHO SEES THAT HER SUCCESS IS HIS SUCCESS 
tst2013.talkid1666_052 IT 'S NOT TO SAY THAT OUR MOTHERS AREN'T KEY IN OUR SUCCESS 
tst2013.talkid1666_053 IN FACT THERE ARE OFTEN THE INITIAL AND CONVINCING NEGOTIATORS OF A BRIGHT FUTURE FOR THEIR DAUGHTERS BUT IN THE CONTEXT OF A SOCIETY LIKE IN AFGHANISTAN WE MUST HAVE THE SUPPORT OF MEN 
tst2013.talkid1666_054 UNDER THE TALIBAN GIRLS WHO WENT TO SCHOOL NUMBERED IN HUNDREDS REMEMBER IT WAS ILLEGAL 
tst2013.talkid1666_055 BUT TODAY MORE THAN THREE MILLION GIRLS ARE IN SCHOOL IN AFGHANISTAN 
tst2013.talkid1666_056 AFGHANISTAN LOOKS SO DIFFERENT FROM HERE IN AMERICA 
tst2013.talkid1666_057 I FIND THAT AMERICAN SEE THE FRAGILITY AND CHANGES 
tst2013.talkid1666_058 I FEAR THAT THESE CHANGES WILL NOT LAST MUCH BEYOND THE US TROOPS WITHDRAWAL 
tst2013.talkid1666_059 BUT WHEN I AM BACK IN AFGHANISTAN WHEN I SEE THE STUDENTS AND MY SCHOOL AND THEIR PARENTS WHO ADVOCATE FOR THEM WHO ENCOURAGE THEM I SEE A PROMISING FUTURE AND LASTING CHANGE 
tst2013.talkid1666_060 TO ME AFGHANISTAN IS A COUNTRY OF HOPE AND BOUNDLESS POSSIBILITIES AND EVERY SINGLE DAY THE GIRLS OFF SOLAR REMIND ME OF THAT 
tst2013.talkid1666_061 LIKE ME THEY ARE DREAMING BIG 
tst2013.talkid1666_062 THANK YOU 
tst2013.talkid1673_000 THIS MORNING I'M SPEAKING ON THE QUESTION OF CORRUPTION 
tst2013.talkid1673_001 AND CORRUPTION IS DEFINED AS THE ABUSE OF A POSITION OF TRUST FOR THE BENEFIT OF YOURSELF OR IN THE CASE OF OUR CONTEXT YOUR FRIENDS YOUR FAMILY OR FINANCIERS 
tst2013.talkid1673_002 OKAY FRIENDS FAMILY AND 
tst2013.talkid1673_003 WHAT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE UNDERSTAND ABOUT CORRUPTION AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE BEEN MISEDUCATED ABOUT IT WE HAVE TO ADMIT THAT 
tst2013.talkid1673_004 WHETHER THE COURAGE ADMIT THAT TO START CHANGING HOW WE DEAL WITH IT 
tst2013.talkid1673_005 THE FIRST THING IS THAT THE BIG MYTH NUMBER ONE IS THAT IN FACT IT 'S NOT REALLY A CRIME 
tst2013.talkid1673_006 WHEN WE GET TOGETHER WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY OR WE DISCUSS CRIME IN OUR COUNTRY PRIME IN BELMONT OR CRIME INDIGO OR CRIME IN MARABELLA NOBODY SPEAKING ABOUT CORRUPTION 
tst2013.talkid1673_007 THAT'S THE HONEST TRUTH 
tst2013.talkid1673_008 WHERE THE COMMISSION OF POLICE COMES ON TV TO TALK ABOUT CRIME HE ISN'T SPEAKING ABOUT CORRUPTION 
tst2013.talkid1673_009 AND WE KNOW FOR SURE MANY MINISTER NATIONAL SECURITY SPEAKING ABOUT TALKING ABOUT CORRUPTION I 
tst2013.talkid1673_010 THE POINT THAT MAKING IS THAT IT IS A CRIME 
tst2013.talkid1673_011 IT 'S AN ECONOMIC CRIME BECAUSE WE INVOLVING IN BOOTING OF TAXPAYERS MONEY 
tst2013.talkid1673_012 PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CORRUPTION IS A REALITY 
tst2013.talkid1673_013 SOMEBODY WHO COMES ONLY PRIVATE SECTOR I COULD TELL YOU THERE 'S A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF CORRUPTION IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH GOVERNMENT 
tst2013.talkid1673_014 THE SAME BRIBES AND BACK AND AS AN THINGS THAT TAKE PLACE UNDER THE TABLE IT ALL TAKES PLACE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR 
tst2013.talkid1673_015 TODAY I'M FOCUSING ON PUBLIC SECTOR CORRUPTION WHICH PRIVATE CYCLES OF PARTICIPATES IN 
tst2013.talkid1673_016 THE SECOND IMPORTANT MYTH TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DESTROY THESE MYTHS DISMANTLE THEM AND DESTROY THEM AND RIDICULE THEM THE SECOND IMPORTANT MYTH TO UNDERSTAND IS THE ONE THAT SAYS THAT IN FACT CORRUPTION IS ONLY A SMALL PROBLEMS IF IT IS A PROBLEM IT'S ONLY A SMALL PROBLEM THAT IN FACT IT'S ONLY A LITTLE TEN OR FIFTEEN PERCENT IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOREVER IT PROBABLY WILL CONTINUE FOREVER AND THERE'S NO POINT PASSING ANY LAWS BECAUSE A LITTLE WE CAN DO ABOUT IT 
tst2013.talkid1673_017 AND I WANT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THAT TOO IS A DANGEROUS MYTH VERY DANGEROUS 
tst2013.talkid1673_018 IS A PIECE OF PUBLIC MISCHIEF 
tst2013.talkid1673_019 AND I WANT TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TAKE US BACK ABOUT THIRTY YEARS 
tst2013.talkid1673_020 WE'RE COMING OUT THE TODAY FROM TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO A RESOURCE RICH SMALL CARIBBEAN COUNTRY AND IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHERE A MASSIVE INCREASE IN COUNTRIES WEALTH AND THAT INCREASE WAS CAUSED BY THE INCREASE IN WORLD OIL PRICES 
tst2013.talkid1673_021 WE CALL THEM PETRODOLLARS THE TREASURY WAS BURSTING AT MONEY 
tst2013.talkid1673_022 AND IT 'S IRONIC BECAUSE WE'RE STANDING TO ANY CENTRAL BANK 
tst2013.talkid1673_023 HISTORIES RICHARD IRONY 
tst2013.talkid1673_024 WE STAND IN THAT ANY CENTRAL BANK AND THE CENTRAL BANKER RESPONSIBLE FOR A LOT OF THE THINGS I'M GOING TO BE SPEAKING ABOUT 
tst2013.talkid1673_025 OKAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IRRESPONSIBILITY IN PUBLIC OFFICE 
tst2013.talkid1673_026 WITH SPEAKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT ACROSS THE TERRORISTS THE NEXT TOWERS THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE AND THESE THERE 'S A LOT OF CONNECTION WITH US TODAY SO IT'S BECAME IT IN THE TEMPLE TODAY OK 
tst2013.talkid1673_027 NOW THE FIRST THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THAT WHEN ALL OF THIS MONEY FLOWED INTO OUR COUNTRY ABOUT FORTY YEARS AGO WE EMBARKED THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY EMBARKED ON A SERIES OF GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT ARRANGEMENTS TO HAVE RAPIDLY DEVELOP THE COUNTRY 
tst2013.talkid1673_028 AND SO THE LARGEST PROJECTS IN A COUNTRY WHERE BEING CONSTRUCTED THROUGH GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT ARRANGEMENTS WITH SOME OF THE LEADING COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD THE UNITED STATES AND BRITAIN AND FRANCE AND SO ON AND SO 
tst2013.talkid1673_029 AS I SAID EVEN THIS BUILDING WITHSTANDING AND THAT'S ONE OF THE IRANIANS THIS BUILDING WAS PART OF THAT SERIES OF COMPLEX IS WHAT WE CALL THE TWIN TOWERS 
tst2013.talkid1673_030 IT BECAME SO OUTRAGEOUS THE WHOLE SITUATION THAT IN FACT A COMMISSION OF INQUIRY WAS APPOINTED AND IT REPORTED IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO THIRTY YEARS AGO IT REPORTED BALLAH REPORT THIRTY YEARS AGO AND IMMEDIATELY THE GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT ARRANGEMENTS WERE STOPPED 
tst2013.talkid1673_031 THEN PRIME MINISTER WENT TO PARLIAMENT TO GIVE A BUDGET SPEECH AND HE SAID SOMETHING THAT I'LL NEVER FORGET 
tst2013.talkid1673_032 THEY WENT RIGHT IN HERE I WAS A YOUNG MINORITY TIME 
tst2013.talkid1673_033 AND RIGHT INTO MY HEART 
tst2013.talkid1673_034 AND HE SAID THAT IN FACT YOU SEE THE SING WORKS 
tst2013.talkid1673_035 WE'RE GETTING YOUR THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD US 
tst2013.talkid1673_036 HE TOLD US THAT IN FACT TO OUT OF EVERY THREE DOLLARS OF OUR PETRODOLLARS WE SPENT TAXPAYERS MONEY WAS WASTED OR STOLEN 
tst2013.talkid1673_037 SO THE TEN OR FIFTEEN PERCENT IS PURE MISCHIEF 
tst2013.talkid1673_038 AS WE SAY IS A NANCY STORY FORGET IT 
tst2013.talkid1673_039 THAT'S A LITTLE CHILDREN WERE BIG PEOPLE TRYING TO DEAL WAS HAPPENING IN OUR SOCIETY 
tst2013.talkid1673_040 OKAY THIS IS THE SIZE OF THE PROBLEM 
tst2013.talkid1673_041 TWO THIRDS OF THE MONEY STOLEN OR WASTED 
tst2013.talkid1673_042 THAT WAS THIRTY YEARS AGO NINETY EIGHT IT WAS BALLAH 
tst2013.talkid1673_043 SO WHAT HAS CHANGED 
tst2013.talkid1673_044 I DON'T LIKE TO BRING UP IN VIRUS IN SECRET IS AN INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCE BUT I HAVE TO 
tst2013.talkid1673_045 FOUR MONTHS AGO HE SUFFERED A CONSTITUTIONAL OUTRAGE IN THIS COUNTRY 
tst2013.talkid1673_046 WE CALL IT THE SECTION THIRTY FOUR FIASCO THE SECTION THIRTY FOUR FIASCO A SUSPICIOUS PIECE OF LAW AND I'M GOING TO SAY IT LIKE IT IS A SUSPICIOUS PIECE OF LAW WAS PASSED AT A SUSPICIOUS TIME TO FREE SOME SUSPECTS 
tst2013.talkid1673_047 THOSE PEOPLE ARE CALLED DPR CO AIRPORT ACCUSED 
tst2013.talkid1673_048 I'M GOING TO HAVE MY OWN LEXICON SPEAKING INTO THE 
tst2013.talkid1673_049 THE ONLY PR CORE AIRPORT ACCUSED 
tst2013.talkid1673_050 IT WAS A CONSTITUTIONAL OUTRAGE OF DIFFERENCE ORDER AND I HAVE LABEL IT THE PLOT TO PROVIDE PARLIAMENT 
tst2013.talkid1673_051 OUR HIGHEST INSTITUTION OUR COUNTRY WAS POVERTY 
tst2013.talkid1673_052 WE ARE DEALING WITH PERVERTS HERE OF AN ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL 
tst2013.talkid1673_053 TO GET OUT SERIOUS THIS PROBLEM IS 
tst2013.talkid1673_054 THERE WAS MASSIVE PROTEST A LOT OF US IN THIS ROOM TO PARTLY PROTESTS IN DIFFERENT FORMS 
tst2013.talkid1673_055 MOST IMPORTANTLY THE AMERICAN EMBASSY COMPLAINED SO PARAMETER SWIFTLY RECONVENED AND THE LAW WAS REVERSED IT WAS REPEALED 
tst2013.talkid1673_056 AS IT WERE LAWYERS USE IT WAS REPEALED 
tst2013.talkid1673_057 BUT THE POINT IS THAT PARLIAMENT WAS ACQUITTED IN A WHOLE COURSE OF EVENTS BECAUSE WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE SUSPICIOUS PASSAGE OF THAT LAW THE LAW IS ACTUALLY PASSED INTO EFFECT ON THE WEEKEND WE CELEBRATED OUR FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF INDEPENDENCE OUR JULIA INDEPENDENCE 
tst2013.talkid1673_058 SO THAT IS THAT IS THE KIND OF OUTRAGE EVERYTHING 
tst2013.talkid1673_059 IT WAS A KIND OF A NASTY WHERE TO GET MATURATION WE GOT IT BECAUSE WE ALL UNDERSTOOD IT AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT I COULD REMEMBER THEY WERE MASS PROTESTS AGAINST THIS CORRUPTION 
tst2013.talkid1673_060 AND THAT WAS THAT GIVE ME A LOT OF HOPE 
tst2013.talkid1673_061 THOSE OF US WHO ARE SOMETIMES YOU FEEL LIKE A LITTLE BIT ON YOUR OWN DOING SOME OF THIS WORK 
tst2013.talkid1673_062 THAT PASSAGE OF THE LAW AND YOU REPEATEDLY LAW FORTIFIED THE CASE OF THE PIANO AIRPORT ACCUSED 
tst2013.talkid1673_063 SO IT WAS ONE OF THOSE REALLY SUPERIOR DOUBLE BLUFF KIND OF THINGS THAT TOOK PLACE 
tst2013.talkid1673_064 WHAT WOULD THE ACCUSED SELF 
tst2013.talkid1673_065 WHAT WAS THAT THEY WERE CUES 
tst2013.talkid1673_066 WHEN A BIT MYSTERIOUS FOR THOSE OF YOU OUT THERE WHAT THE ACCUSED OF 
tst2013.talkid1673_067 WE WERE TRYING TO BUILD ALL RECONSTRUCT LARGELY AN AIRPORT THAT DON'T OUTDATED 
tst2013.talkid1673_068 THE ENTIRE PROJECT COSTS ABOUT ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS DOLLARS DELIGHT AND TOBAGO DOLLARS AND IN FACT WE HAD A LOT OF BID RIGGING AND SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY CORRUPT ACTIVITY TOOK PLACE 
tst2013.talkid1673_069 AND TO GET AN IDEA OF WHAT IT CONSISTED OF AND TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT IN RELATIONSHIP TO THIS WHOLE SECOND MYTH ABOUT IT BEING NO BIG THING WE CAN LOOK AT THE SECOND SLIDER 
tst2013.talkid1673_070 AND WHAT WE HAVE HERE THIS IS NOT I AM NOT SAYING SO THIS IS THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS IN A WRITTEN STATEMENT HE SAID SO 
tst2013.talkid1673_071 AND HE 'S TELLING US THAT FOR THE ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLAR CUSTODY PROJECT ONE BILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN TRACED TO OFFSHORE BANK ACCOUNTS 
tst2013.talkid1673_072 ONE BILLION DOLLARS OF OUR TAXPAYERS MONEY HAS BEEN LOCATED IN OFFSHORE BANK ACCOUNTS

tst2013.talkid1673_078 AND WHAT IT SAID ON THAT SIGN HIT ME RIGHT IN THE CENTER 
tst2013.talkid1673_079 HE SAID IF YOU'RE NOT OUTRAGED YOU HAVEN'T BEEN PAYING ATTENTION 
tst2013.talkid1673_080 IF YOU'RE NOT OUTRAGED BY ALL OF THIS YOUNG BEEN PAYING ATTENTION 
tst2013.talkid1673_081 SO LISTEN UP BECAUSE WE GET IT EVEN DEEPER WATERS

tst2013.talkid1673_149 BUT THE CITY QUESTION IS THIS IF IT 'S RIGHT AND PROPER FOR US TO USE THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT AND TO USE THE COURT TO FORCE THE DISCLOSURE ABOUT SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN PUBLIC MONEY IT MUST BE RIGHT AND PROPER FOR US THE FORCES THERE WERE TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS 
tst2013.talkid1673_150 YOU SEE THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE A PERMANENT SECRETARY THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE WROTE ME AND SAID TO ME THAT INFORMATION IS EXEMPT TOO 
tst2013.talkid1673_151 YOU SEE THIS IS WHAT WE DID IT OKAY 
tst2013.talkid1673_152 THE THIRD THING I WOULD TELL YOU IS THAT I ALSO ASKED FOR THE DIRECTORS OF CL FINANCIAL WHETHER IN FACT THEY WERE MAKING FILINGS UNDER OUR INTEGRITY IN PUBLIC LIFE ACT 
tst2013.talkid1673_153 GIVEN INTEGRITY IN PUBLIC LIFE ACT AS PART OF OUR FRAMEWORK SUPPOSED TO SAFEGUARD THE NATIONS INTEREST 
tst2013.talkid1673_154 AND PUBLIC OFFICIALS AS OPPOSED TO FILE TO SAY WHAT IT IS THEY HAVE IN TERMS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES 
tst2013.talkid1673_155 AND OF COURSE HAVE SINCE DISCOVERED THAT THEY 'RE NOT FILING AND IN FACT THE MINISTER OF FINANCE IS NOT A MASS TIMBER 
tst2013.talkid1673_156 SO HERE WE HAVE IT WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THE BASIC SAFEGUARDS OF INTEGRITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY HAVE ALL BEEN DISCARDED 
tst2013.talkid1673_157 ASK THE QUESTION IN LEGAL REQUIRED FASHION 
tst2013.talkid1673_158 IT'S BEEN IGNORED 
tst2013.talkid1673_159 THE SORT OF THING THAT MOTIVATED US AROUND SECTION THIRTY FOUR WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT WE CAN FORGET IT 
tst2013.talkid1673_160 I HAVE DEFINED THIS IS THE SINGLE LARGEST EXPENDITURE IN THE COUNTRY 'S HISTORY 
tst2013.talkid1673_161 IT 'S ALSO THE SINGLE LARGEST EXAMPLE OF PUBLIC CORRUPTION ACCORDING TO THIS EQUATION 
tst2013.talkid1673_162 AND THIS IS MY REALITY CHECK 
tst2013.talkid1673_163 WHERE YOU HAVE AN EXPENDITURE OF PUBLIC MONEY AND IT IS WITHOUT ACCOUNTABILITY AND IT'S WITHOUT TRANSPARENCY IT WILL ALWAYS BE EQUAL TO CORRUPTION WHETHER YOU IN RUSSIA OR NIGERIA OR ALASKA IT WILL ALWAYS BE EQUAL TO CORRUPTION AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH HERE 
tst2013.talkid1673_164 I'M GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK TO PRESS ON TO GET SOME RESOLUTION OF THOSE MATTERS THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE 
tst2013.talkid1673_165 IT IS I HAVE TO GO TO COURT PERSONALLY I WILL DO THAT 
tst2013.talkid1673_166 WE WILL CONTINUE TO PRESS ON 
tst2013.talkid1673_167 WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITHIN JCC 
tst2013.talkid1673_168 BUT I WANT TO STEP BACK FROM TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO CONTEXT AND BRING SOMETHING NEW TO THE TABLE IN TERMS OF AN INTERNATIONAL EXAMPLE 
tst2013.talkid1673_169 WE HAD THE JOURNALISTS REBECCA BROOKE SPEAKING ABOUT THE BATTLE AGAINST GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION ENERGY INTRODUCED ME TO THIS WEBSITE ARE THE TELE DOTCOM 
tst2013.talkid1673_170 THE TELE DOTCOM IS A WAY FOR US TO HAVE AN OPEN DATABASE FOR FREEDOM AND INFORMATION APPLICATIONS AND SPEAK WITH EACH OTHER 
tst2013.talkid1673_171 I COULD SEE WHAT YOU'RE APPLYING FOR 
tst2013.talkid1673_172 YOU COULD SEE WHAT I APPLIED FOR WHAT REPLIES I GOT 
tst2013.talkid1673_173 WE CAN WORK ON IT TOGETHER WE NEED TO BUILD A COLLECTIVE DATABASE AND COLLECTIVE UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE WE ARE TO GO TO THE NEXT 
tst2013.talkid1673_174 TO INCREASE THE CONSCIOUSNESS 
tst2013.talkid1673_175 THE FINAL THING I WANT TO SAY IS IN RELATION TO THIS ONE WHICH IS A LOVELY WEBSITE FROM INDIA CALLED I PAID A BRIBE DOTCOM 
tst2013.talkid1673_176 HAVE INTERNATIONAL BRANCHES AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO TUNE INTO THIS ONE 
tst2013.talkid1673_177 I PAY A BRIBE DOTCOM IS REALLY IMPORTANT GOOD WANT A LOG ONTO AND SEE 
tst2013.talkid1673_178 AND WHEN A PAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO ASK IF WE ARE COURAGE 
tst2013.talkid1673_179 DISCARD THE FIRST METHOD IS A CRIME 
tst2013.talkid1673_180 DESCRIBE THE SECOND MYTH IT IS A BIG THING

tst2013.talkid1699_013 SO I HAD TO FIND A WAY OF SOLVING THIS PROBLEM 
tst2013.talkid1699_014 AND THE FIRST IDEA GOD WAS TO USE FIRE BECAUSE I DON'T LANDS WAS GET OF FIRE 
tst2013.talkid1699_015 BUT I CAME TO REALIZE THAT THAT DIDN'T REALLY HAD BECAUSE IT WAS EVEN HELPING THE LENS C C DREW THE CAUTION 
tst2013.talkid1699_016 SO I DIDN'T GIVE UP I CONTINUED 
tst2013.talkid1699_017 AND THE SECOND IDEA GOOD OWES CHOOSES CHEMICAL 
tst2013.talkid1699_018 OUR CENTER PARTICULAR LOANS THAT I WAS STANDING NEAR THE CAUTION 
tst2013.talkid1699_019 ALLOWS OUR VERY CLEVER 
tst2013.talkid1699_020 THEY WILL COME THE FIRST DAY AND THEY SEE THIS CHEMICAL AND THEY GO BACK BUT THE SECOND DAY THEIR COMMON HE SAID THIS THING IS NO MOVING IA IT'S OLIVIA 
tst2013.talkid1699_021 SO IT DOES IN AND CHILDREN 
tst2013.talkid1699_022 SO ONE NIGHT I WAS WALKING ON THEIR CAUTION WITHOUT TOWARDS AND THAT DAY THE LAST INCOME

tst2013.talkid1699_028 AND OTHER SMALL TORCH FROM A BROKEN FLASHLIGHT 
tst2013.talkid1699_029 SO I SET UP EVERYTHING 
tst2013.talkid1699_030 AS YOU CAN SEE A SOLAR PANEL CHARGES A BATTERY AND THE BATTERY SUPPLIES THE POWER TO THE SMALL INDICATOR BOX I CALL IT A TRANSFORMER 
tst2013.talkid1699_031 AND INDEED THE BOOKS NEXT ALLIES TO FLUSH 
tst2013.talkid1699_032 AS YOU CAN SEE THE BOB 'S FACE OUTSIDE BECAUSE THAT 'S WHERE THE LIONS COME FROM 
tst2013.talkid1699_033 AND THAT 'S HOW LOOKS TO LIONS WHEN THEY COME A NIGHT 
tst2013.talkid1699_034 THE LIGHTS FLASHED AND TRICK LESSONS THAT I WAS WALKING AROUND THE CAUTION BUT OF SLEEPING IN MY BED

tst2013.talkid1699_042 SAYS NOW I'VE SET UP SEVEN BOMBERS AROUND MY COMMUNITY AND THERE ARE WHAT 
tst2013.talkid1699_043 AND MY IDEA IS ALSO BEEN USE NO IN ALL OF OUR KENYA FOR SCARING OTHER PREDATORS LIKE HYENAS LEOPARDS AND ALSO IT WAS A MENUS TO SCALE ELEPHANTS OUR FROM PEOPLES FARMS 
tst2013.talkid1699_044 BECAUSE OF THIS INVENTION I WAS LIKE TOGETHER SCHOLARSHIP IN ONE OF THE BEST SCHOOLS IN KENYA BECAUSE INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL AND I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT

tst2013.talkid1699_053 YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW EXCITING IT IS TO HEAR A STORY LIKE YOURS 
tst2013.talkid1699_054 SO HE WAS A SCHOLARSHIP 
tst2013.talkid1699_055 YOUR WORKING ON OTHER ELECTRICAL INVENTIONS 
tst2013.talkid1699_056 THAT'S THE NEXT ONE ON YOUR LEFT 
tst2013.talkid1699_057 MY NEXT INVENTION IS I WANT TO MAKE AN ELECTRIC FENCE ELECTRIC FENCE 
tst2013.talkid1699_058 BUT I KNOW ELECTRIC FENCES ALREADY INVENTED BUT I WANT TO MAKE MINE 
tst2013.talkid1699_059 YOUR TO TRY TO AFTER I DID BEFORE BUT BECAUSE AGAIN I SHOOK 
tst2013.talkid1699_060 IN THE TRENCHES WHICH ARE VERY YOU ARE SOMETHING ELSE

tst2013.talkid1699_062 THANK YOU SO MUCH 
tst2013.talkid1532_000 BEFORE MARCH TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN I WAS A PHOTOGRAPHIC RETOUCHER BASED IN NEW YORK CITY 
tst2013.talkid1532_001 NOW WE'RE PALE GRAY CREATURES 
tst2013.talkid1532_002 WE HIDE IN DARK WINDOWLESS ROOMS AND GENERALLY AVOID SUNLIGHT 
tst2013.talkid1532_003 WE MAKE SKINNY MODELS SKINNIER PERFECT SKIN MORE PERFECT AND THE IMPOSSIBLE POSSIBLE AND WE GET CRITICIZED IN THE PRESS ALL THE TIME BUT SOME OF US ARE ACTUALLY TALENTED ARTISTS WITH YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND A REAL APPRECIATION FOR IMAGES AND PHOTOGRAPHY 
tst2013.talkid1532_004 HOW MUCH ELEVENTH TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN I WATCH FROM HOME AS THE REST OF THE WORLD DID AS THE TRAGIC EVENTS UNFOLDED IN JAPAN 
tst2013.talkid1532_005 SOON AFTER AN ORGANIZATION I VOLUNTEER WE'RE ALL HANDS VOLUNTEERS WERE ON THE GROUND WITHIN DAYS WORKING IS PART OF THE RESPONSE EFFORTS 
tst2013.talkid1532_006 I ALONG WITH HUNDREDS OF OTHER VOLUNTEERS KNEW WE COULDN'T JUST SIT AT HOME SO I DECIDED TO JOIN THEM FOR THREE WEEKS 
tst2013.talkid1532_007 ON MY THE THIRTEENTH I MADE MY WAY TO THE TOWN OF OFTEN ART 
tst2013.talkid1532_008 IT 'S A SMALL FISHING TOWN IN THE WATER PREFECTURE ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ONE OF THE FIRST THAT WAS HIT BY THE WAVE 
tst2013.talkid1532_009 THE WATERS HERE HAVE BEEN RECORDED AT REACHING OVER TWENTY FOUR METERS IN HEIGHT AND TRAVELED OVER TWO MILES INLAND 
tst2013.talkid1532_010 AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THE TOWN HAD BEEN DEVASTATED 
tst2013.talkid1532_011 WE PULLED DEBRIS FROM CANALS AND DITCHES 
tst2013.talkid1532_012 WE CLEANED SCHOOLS WE DEMANDED AND GUTTED HOMES READY FOR RENOVATION AND REHABILITATION 
tst2013.talkid1532_013 WE CLEARED TONS AND TONS OF STINKING ROTTING FISH CARCASSES FROM THE LOCAL FISH PROCESSING PLANT 
tst2013.talkid1532_014 WE GOT DIRTY AND WE LOVED IT 
tst2013.talkid1532_015 FOR WEEKS ALL THE VOLUNTEERS AND LOCALS ALIKE HAD BEEN FINDINGS SIMILAR THINGS 
tst2013.talkid1532_016 I'VE BEEN FINDING PHOTOS AND PHOTO ALBUMS AND CAMERAS AND ESTEY CARS 
tst2013.talkid1532_017 EVERYONE IS DOING THE SAME 
tst2013.talkid1532_018 THEY WERE COLLECTING THEM UP AND HANDING THEM INTO VARIOUS PLACES AROUND THE DIFFERENT TOWNS FOR SAFEKEEPING 
tst2013.talkid1532_019 NOW IT WASN'T UNTIL THIS POINT THAT I REALIZED THAT THESE PHOTOS WAS SUCH A HUGE PART OF THE PERSONAL LOSS THESE PEOPLE HAD FELL 
tst2013.talkid1532_020 AS THEY HAD LEARNED FROM THE WAVE AND FOR THEIR LIVES ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING THEY HAD EVERYTHING HAD TO BE LEFT BEHIND 
tst2013.talkid1532_021 AT THE END OF MY FIRST WEEK THERE I FOUND MYSELF HELPING OUT AN EVACUATION CENTER IN THE TOWN 
tst2013.talkid1532_022 I WAS HELPING CLEAN THE ARMS THAN THE COMMUNAL COMMUNAL ONSEN THE HUGE GIANT BATHTUBS 
tst2013.talkid1532_023 THIS HAPPENED TO ALSO BE A PLACE IN THE TOWN WHERE THE EVACUATION CENTER WAS COLLECTING THE PHOTOS 
tst2013.talkid1532_024 THIS WHERE PEOPLE HANDING THEM IN AND I WAS HONOURED THAT DAY THAT THEY ACTUALLY TRUSTED ME TO HELP THEM START HANG CLEANING THEM 
tst2013.talkid1532_025 NOW IT WAS EMOTIONAL AND IT WAS INSPIRING AND I'VE ALWAYS HEARD ABOUT THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL I ACTUALLY GOTTEN OUTSIDE OF MY BOX THAT SOMETHING HAPPENED 
tst2013.talkid1532_026 AS I LOOKED THROUGH THE PHOTO SOMEWHERE OVER A HUNDRED YEARS OLD SOME STILL IN THE ENVELOPE FROM THE PROCESSING LAB I COULDN 'T HELP BUT THINK IS A RETOUCHER THAT I COULD FIX THAT TEAR AND MEN THAT SCRATCH AND I KNEW HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO COULD DO THE SAME 
tst2013.talkid1532_027 SO THAT EVENING I JUST REACHED OUT ON FACEBOOK ANNOUNCED A FEW OF THEM AND BY MORNING THE RESPONSIBLY AND SO OVERWHELMING IS SO POSITIVE I KNEW WE HAD TO GIVE A GO 
tst2013.talkid1532_028 SO WE STARTED RETOUCHING PHOTOS 
tst2013.talkid1532_029 THIS WAS THE VERY FIRST 
tst2013.talkid1532_030 NOT TERRIBLY DAMAGED BUT WHERE THOSE THROUGH THE WATER HAD CAUSE THAT DISCOLORATION ON THE GIRLS FACE HAD TO BE REPAIRED WITH SUCH ACCURACY AND DELICACY 
tst2013.talkid1532_031 OTHERWISE THAT LITTLE GIRL ISN'T GOING TO LOOK LIKE THAT LITTLE GIRL ANYMORE AND SURELY THAT'S AS TRAGIC AS HAVING THE PHOTO DAMAGED 
tst2013.talkid1532_032 OVER TIME MORE PHOTOS CAME IN THANKFULLY AND MORE RETOUCHERS WERE NEEDED AND SO I REACHED OUT AGAIN ON FACEBOOK AND LINKED IN AND WITHIN FIVE DAYS EIGHTY PEOPLE WANTED TO HELP FROM TWELVE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES 
tst2013.talkid1532_033 WITHIN TWO WEEKS I HAD ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE WANTING TO JOIN IN 
tst2013.talkid1532_034 WITHIN JAPAN BY JULY WE BRANCHED OUT TO THE NEIGHBORING TOWN OF RIKUZENTAKATA FURTHER NORTH TO A TOWN CALLED YAMADA 
tst2013.talkid1532_035 ONCE A WEEK WE WOULD SET UP OUR SCANNING EQUIPMENT IN THE TEMPORARY PHOTO LIBRARIES THAT BEEN SET UP WHERE PEOPLE WERE RECLAIMING THEIR PHOTOS 
tst2013.talkid1532_036 THE OLDER LADIES SOMETIMES HADN'T SEEN THE SCANNER BEFORE BUT WITHIN TEN MINUTES OF THEM FINDING THEIR LAST PHOTO THEY COULD GIVE IT TO US HABIT SCANNED UPLOADED TO A CLOUDS OVER IT BE DOWNLOADED BY A GUY AGING STRANGER SOMEWHERE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLOBE AND IT STOP IN FIXED 
tst2013.talkid1532_037 THE TIME IT TOOK HOWEVER TO GET IT BACK AS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STORY AND IT DEPENDED OBVIOUSLY ON THE DAMAGE INVOLVED 
tst2013.talkid1532_038 IT COULD TAKE AN HOUR IT COULD TAKE WEEKS 
tst2013.talkid1532_039 IT COULD TAKE MONTHS 
tst2013.talkid1532_040 BECOME MONO IN THIS SHOT PRETTY MUCH HAD TO BE HAND DRAWN OR PIECED TOGETHER PICKING OUT THE REMAINING PARTS OF COLOR AND DETAIL THAT THE WATER HADN 'T DAMAGED 
tst2013.talkid1532_041 IT WAS VERY TIME CONSUMING 
tst2013.talkid1532_042 NOW ALL THESE PHOTOS HAVE BEEN DAMAGED BY WATER SUBMERGED IN SALT WATER COVERED IN BACTERIA IN SEWAGE SOMETIMES EVEN OIL ALL OF WHICH OVER TIME IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO DAMAGE THEM SO HANG CLEANING THEM WAS A HUGE PART OF THE PROJECT 
tst2013.talkid1532_043 WE COULDN'T RETOUCH THE PHOTO UNLESS IT WAS CLEAN DRY AND RECLAIMED 
tst2013.talkid1532_044 AND WE WERE LUCKY WITHOUT HANG CLEANING 
tst2013.talkid1532_045 WE HAD AN AMAZING LOCAL WOMAN WHO WHO GUIDED US 
tst2013.talkid1532_046 IT 'S VERY EASY TO DO MORE DAMAGE IN THE FOOT TO THOSE DAMAGE PHOTOS 
tst2013.talkid1532_047 AS MY TEAM LEADER WHEN ONCE SAID IT'S LIKE DOING A TATTOO ON SOMEONE 
tst2013.talkid1532_048 YOU DON'T GET A CHANCE TO MESS IT UP 
tst2013.talkid1532_049 THE LADY WHO BROUGHT US THESE PHOTOS WAS LUCKY AS FAR AS THE PHOTOS GO 
tst2013.talkid1532_050 SHE HAD STARTED HANG CLEANING THEM HERSELF AND STOPPED WHEN SHE REALIZED SHE WAS DOING MORE DAMAGE 
tst2013.talkid1532_051 SHE ALSO HAD DUPLICATE 
tst2013.talkid1532_052 AREAS LIKE A HUSBAND AND HER FACE WHICH OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIX WE COULD JUST PUT THEM TOGETHER IN ONE GOOD PHOTO AND REMAKE A WHOLE PHOTO 
tst2013.talkid1532_053 WHEN SHE COLLECTED THE PHOTOS FROM A SHE SHARED A BIT OF A STORY WITH US 
tst2013.talkid1532_054 HER PHOTOS WERE FOUND BY HER HUSBAND 'S COLLEAGUES AT LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT IN THE DEBRIS A LONG WAY FROM WHERE THE HOME ONCE STOOD AND THEY RECOGNIZED HIM 
tst2013.talkid1532_055 THE DAY THE TSUNAMI HAD ACTUALLY BEEN IN CHARGE OF MAKING SURE THE TSUNAMI GATES WERE CLOSED 
tst2013.talkid1532_056 HE HAD TO GO TOWARDS THE WATER WAS THE SIRENS SOUNDED 
tst2013.talkid1532_057 HOW TO LITTLE BOYS NOT SO LITTLE ANYMORE BUT HAD TWO BOYS WERE BOTH AT SCHOOL SEPARATE SCHOOLS 
tst2013.talkid1532_058 ONE OF THEM GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE WATER 
tst2013.talkid1532_059 IT TOOK OR A WEEK TO FIND THEM ALL AGAIN AND FIND OUT THAT DATA SURVIVED 
tst2013.talkid1532_060 THE DAY I GAVE HER THE PHOTOS ALSO HAPPEN TO BE HERE YOUNGEST SON 'S FOURTEENTH BIRTHDAY 
tst2013.talkid1532_061 FOR HER DESPITE ALL OF THIS THOSE PHOTOS WITH A PERFECT GIFT BACK TO HIM SOMETHING YOU COULD LOOK AT AGAINST LYING HE REMEMBERED FROM BEFORE THAT THAT WASN'T STILL SCARRED FROM THAT DAY IN MARCH WHEN ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING ELSE IN HIS LIFE IT CHANGED OR BEEN DESTROYED 
tst2013.talkid1532_062 AFTER SIX MONTHS IN JAPAN ELEVEN HUNDRED VOLUNTEERS HAD PASSED THROUGH ALL HANDS HUNDREDS OF WHOM HAD HELPED US HANG CLEAN OVER A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND PHOTOGRAPHS THE LARGE MOVED 
tst2013.talkid1532_063 DID ACTUALLY FIND THEIR HOME AGAIN IMPORTANT 
tst2013.talkid1532_064 OVER FIVE HUNDRED VOLUNTEERS AROUND THE GLOBE HELPED US GET NINETY FAMILIES HUNDREDS OF PHOTOGRAPHS BACK FULLY RESTORED UN RETOUCHED 
tst2013.talkid1532_065 DURING THIS TIME WE HADN 'T REALLY SPENT MORE THAN ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS IN EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS MOST OF WHICH WAS PRINTER INKS 
tst2013.talkid1532_066 WE TAKE PHOTOS CONSTANTLY 
tst2013.talkid1532_067 THE PHOTO IS A REMINDER OF SOMEONE OR SOMETHING A PLACE A RELATIONSHIP I LOVED ONE 
tst2013.talkid1532_068 THERE ARE MEMORY KEEPERS AND I HISTORIES THE LAST THING WE WOULD GRAB AND THE FIRST THING YOU'D GO BACK TO LOOK FOR 
tst2013.talkid1532_069 THAT 'S ALL THIS PROJECT WAS ABOUT ABOUT RESTORING THOSE LITTLE BITS OF HUMANITY GIVING SOMEONE THAT CONNECTION BACK 
tst2013.talkid1532_070 WHEN A PHOTO LIKE THIS CAN BE RETURNED TO SOMEONE LIKE THIS IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF THE PERSON RECEIVING IT 
tst2013.talkid1532_071 THE PROJECT ALSO MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF THE RETOUCHERS 
tst2013.talkid1532_072 FOR SOME OF THEM GIVING THEM A CONNECTION TO SOMETHING BIGGER GIVING SOMETHING BACK USING THEIR TALENTS ON SOMETHING OTHER THAN SKINNY MODELS AND PERFECT SKIN 
tst2013.talkid1532_073 I WOULD LIKE TO CONCLUDE BY REALLY AN EMAIL I GOT FROM ONE OF THEM CINDY THE DAY I FINALLY GOT BACK FROM JAPAN AFTER SIX MONTHS 
tst2013.talkid1532_074 AS I WORKED I COULDN 'T HELP BUT THINK ABOUT THE INDIVIDUALS AND THE STORIES REPRESENTED IN THE IMAGES 
tst2013.talkid1532_075 ONE IN PARTICULAR A PHOTO OF WOMEN OF ALL AGES FROM GRANDMOTHER TO LITTLE GIRL GATHERED AROUND A BABY STRUCK ACCORD BECAUSE A SIMILAR PHOTO FROM MY FAMILY MY GRANDMOTHER MOTHER MYSELF AND NEWBORN DAUGHTER HANGS ON OUR WALL 
tst2013.talkid1532_076 ACROSS THE GLOBE THROUGHOUT THE AGES OUR BASIC NEEDS ARE JUST THE SAME 
tst2013.talkid1532_077 THANK YOU 
tst2013.talkid1534_000 SO WELL I DO APPLIED MATH AND THIS IS A PECULIAR PROBLEM FOR ANYONE IT DOES APPLIED MATH IS THAT WE LIKE MANAGEMENT CONSULTANTS 
tst2013.talkid1534_001 NO ONE KNOWS WHAT THE HELL WE DO 
tst2013.talkid1534_002 SO I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME ATTEMPT TODAY TO TRY AND EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT I DO 
tst2013.talkid1534_003 SO DANCING IS WHEN THE MOST HUMAN OF ACTIVITIES 
tst2013.talkid1534_004 WE DELIGHT AT BALLET VIRTUOSO 'S AND TAP DANCERS YOU WILL SEE LATER ON 
tst2013.talkid1534_005 NOW BALLET REQUIRES AN EXTRAORDINARY LEVEL OF EXPERTISE AND A HIGH LEVEL OF SKILL AND PROBABLY A LEVEL OF INITIAL SUITABILITY THAT MAY WELL HAVE A GENETIC COMPONENT TO IT 
tst2013.talkid1534_006 NOW SADLY NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS SUCH AS PARKINSON DISEASE GRADUALLY DESTROY THIS EXTRAORDINARY ABILITY AS IT IS DOING TO MY FRIEND JAN STRIPLING WHO WAS A VIRTUOSO BALLET DANCER IN HIS TIME 
tst2013.talkid1534_007 SO GREAT PROGRESS AND TREATMENT HAS BEEN MADE OVER THE YEARS 
tst2013.talkid1534_008 HOWEVER THERE ARE SIX POINT THREE MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE WHO HAVE THE DISEASE AND THEY HAVE TO LIVE WITH INCURABLE WEAKNESS TREMOR RIGIDITY ANY OTHER SYMPTOMS OF GO ALONG DISEASE SO WHAT WE NEED ARE OBJECTIVE TOOLS TO DETECT DISEASE BEFORE IT 'S TOO LATE 
tst2013.talkid1534_009 WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MEASURE PROGRESSION OBJECTIVELY AND ULTIMATELY WE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO KNOW WHEN WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CURE IS WHEN WE HAVE AN OBJECTIVE MEASURE THAT CAN ANSWER THAT FOR SURE 
tst2013.talkid1534_010 BUT FRUSTRATING WITH PARKINSON DISEASE ANOTHER MOVEMENT DISORDERS THERE ARE NO BIOMARKERS SO NOTABLE BLOOD TESTS THAT YOU CAN DO AND THE BEST WE HAVE JUST LIKE THIS TWENTY MINUTE NEUROLOGIST TEST 
tst2013.talkid1534_011 YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE CLINIC TO DO IT IS VERY COSTLY AND THAT MEANS OUTSIDE THE CLINICAL TRIALS IT 'S JUST NEVER DONE IT'S NEVER DONE 
tst2013.talkid1534_012 BUT WHAT IF PATIENTS COULD DO THIS TEST AT HOME 
tst2013.talkid1534_013 NOW THAT WOULD ACTUALLY SAY ONE DIFFICULT TRIP TO CLINIC AND WHAT IF PATIENTS COULD DO THAT TEST THEMSELVES RIGHT 
tst2013.talkid1534_014 NOW EXPENSIVE STAFF TIME REQUIRED 
tst2013.talkid1534_015 ABOUT THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS WHAT AWAY IN THE NEUROLOGIST CLEARLY TO DO IT 
tst2013.talkid1534_016 SO WHAT I WANT TO PROPOSE TO YOU AS AN UNCONVENTIONAL WAY IN WHICH WE CAN TRY TO ACHIEVE THIS BECAUSE YOU SEE IN ONE SENSE AT LEAST WE ARE ALL VIRTUOSO 'S LIKE MY FRIEND JAN STRIPLING 
tst2013.talkid1534_017 SO HERE WE HAVE A VIDEO OF THE VIBRATING VOCAL FOLDS 
tst2013.talkid1534_018 NOW THIS IS HEALTHY AND THIS SOMEBODY MAKING SPEECH SOUNDS AND WE CAN THINK OF OURSELVES AS VOCAL BALLET DANCERS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO COORDINATE ALL OF THESE VOCAL ORGANS WHEN WE MAKE SOUNDS AND WE ALL ACTUALLY HAVE THE GENES FOR IT FOXP YOU TO FOR EXAMPLE 
tst2013.talkid1534_019 AND LIKE BALLET IT TAKES AN EXTRAORDINARY LEVEL OF TRAINING 
tst2013.talkid1534_020 I MEAN JUST THINK HOW LONG IT TAKES A CHILD TO LEARN TO SPEAK 
tst2013.talkid1534_021 AND FROM THE SOUND WE CAN ACTUALLY TRACK THE VOCAL FALL POSITION AS IT VIBRATES AND JUSTICE LIMBS ARE AFFECTED IN PARKINSON'S SO TO ART VOCAL ORGANS 
tst2013.talkid1534_022 SO IN THE BOTTOM TRACE YOU CAN SEE EXAMPLE OF IRREGULAR VOCAL TREMOR 
tst2013.talkid1534_023 WE SEE ALL THE SAME SYMPTOMS 
tst2013.talkid1534_024 YOU SEE VOCAL TREMOR WEAKNESS AND RIGIDITY 
tst2013.talkid1534_025 SPEECH ACTUALLY BECOMES QUIETER MORE BREATHY AFTER ONE THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE SYMPTOMS OF IT 
tst2013.talkid1534_026 SO THESE VOCAL EFFECTS CAN ACTUALLY QUITE SUBTLE IN SOME CASES BUT WITH ANY DIGITAL MICROPHONE AND USING PRECISION VOICE ANALYSIS SOFTWARE IN COMBINATION THE LATEST MACHINE LEARNING WHICH IS VERY ADVANCED BY NOW WE CAN NOW QUANTIFY EXACTLY WHERE SOME RELIES ON A CONTINUUM BETWEEN HEALTH AND DISEASE USING VOICE SIGNALS ALONE 
tst2013.talkid1534_027 SO THESE VOICE BASED TESTS HOW DOES STACK UP AGAINST EXPERT CLINICAL TESTS WERE BOTH NON INVASIVE 
tst2013.talkid1534_028 THE NEUROLOGIST TESTED NONINVASIVE THE BOTH USE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE 
tst2013.talkid1534_029 DON'T HAVE TO DESIGN A WHOLE NEW SET OF HOSPITALS TO DO IT 
tst2013.talkid1534_030 AND BOTH ACCURATE OKAY BUT IN ADDITION VOICE BASED TESTS ARE NON EXPERT 
tst2013.talkid1534_031 THAT MEANS THEY CAN BE SELF ADMINISTERED 
tst2013.talkid1534_032 THEIR HIGH SPEED TAKE ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS AT MOST 
tst2013.talkid1534_033 THEIR ULTRA LOW COST AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS 
tst2013.talkid1534_034 WHEN SOMETHING BECOMES ULTRA LOW COST IT BECOMES MASSIVELY SCALABLE 
tst2013.talkid1534_035 AND SO HERE ARE SOME AMAZING GOALS I THINK WE CAN DEAL WITH NOW 
tst2013.talkid1534_036 WE CAN REDUCE LOGISTICAL DIFFICULTIES FOR PATIENTS 
tst2013.talkid1534_037 NO NEED TO GO TO THE CLINIC FOR ROUTINE CHECKUP 
tst2013.talkid1534_038 WE CAN DO HIGH FREQUENCY MONITORING TO GET OBJECTIVE DATA 
tst2013.talkid1534_039 WE CAN PERFORM LOW COST MASS RECRUITMENT FOR CLINICAL TRIALS AND WE CAN MAKE POPULATION SCALE SCREENING FEASIBLE FOR THE FIRST TIME 
tst2013.talkid1534_040 WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO START TO SEARCH FOR THE EARLY BIOMARKERS DISEASE BEFORE IT 'S TOO LATE 
tst2013.talkid1534_041 SO TAKING THE FIRST STEPS TOWARDS THIS TODAY WERE LAUNCHING A PARKINSON 'S VOICE INITIATIVE 
tst2013.talkid1534_042 WITH ACULAB AND PATIENTS LIKE ME WHERE I'M INTO RECORD OF A LARGE NUMBER OF VOICES WORLDWIDE TO COLLECT ENOUGH DATA TO START TO TACKLE THESE FOUR GOALS 
tst2013.talkid1534_043 WE HAVE LOCAL NUMBERS ACCESSIBLE TO THREE QUARTERS OF BILLION PEOPLE ON THE PLANET 
tst2013.talkid1534_044 ANYONE HEALTHY OR PARKINSON 'S CAN CALL IN CHEAPLY AND LEAVE RECORDINGS A FEW CENTS EACH AND I'M REALLY HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE'VE ALREADY HIT SIX PERCENT OF OUR TARGET JUST IN EIGHT HOURS

tst2013.talkid1539_004 BUT THIS IS THE GEOGRAPHY OF SELF 
tst2013.talkid1539_005 AND SO I STAND HERE TODAY AFGHAN BY BLOOD RED MAKE BY THE GRACE OF GOD AN ATHEIST AND A RADICALLY POLITICIZED ARTIST HAS BEEN LIVING WORKING AND CREATING IN AFGHANISTAN FOR THE LAST NINE YEARS 
tst2013.talkid1539_006 NOW THERE ARE A LOT OF WONDERFUL THINGS THAT YOU COULD MAKE ART ABOUT ENOUGH HONEST ON BUT PERSONALLY I DON'T WANT TO PAINT RAINBOWS I WANT TO MAKE ART THAT DISTURBS IDENTITY IN CHALLENGES AUTHORITY AND EXPOSES HYPOCRISY AND REINTERPRETS REALITY AND EVEN USES KIND OF IMAGINATIVE ETHNOGRAPHY TO TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND THE WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN 
tst2013.talkid1539_007 I WANT TO SPEND A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A JIHADI GANGSTER WHO WE'RE IS HIS JIHAD AGAINST THE COMMUNISTS LIKE POP STAR BULLYING AGAIN AND USES ARMED RELIGIOUS INTIMIDATION AND POLITICAL CORRUPTION TO MAKE THEMSELVES RICH

tst2013.talkid1539_011 I WANT TO LOOK AT HOW IN MY OPINION CONFLICT IN AFGHANISTAN HAS BECOME CONFLICTS SHE 
tst2013.talkid1539_012 THE WAR AND THE EXPATRIATE LIFE THAT COMES WITH IT HAVE CREATED THIS ENVIRONMENT OF STYLE AND FASHION THAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED THROUGH CREATING A FASHION LINE FOR SOLDIERS AND SUICIDE BOMBERS WHERE I TAKE A LOCAL AFGHAN FOX FOR AN ADDED TO A FLAT JACKET OR MAKE MULTIPLE INTERIOR POCKETS ON FASHIONABLE NEO TRADITIONAL VES 
tst2013.talkid1539_013 AND I'D LIKE TO LOOK AT HOW TAKING A SIMPLE KABUL WHEELBARROW AND PUTTING IT ON THE WALL AMIDST KIPLING 'S CALL OF EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE TO GENERATE DIALOGUE ABOUT HOW I SEE CONTEMPORARY DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES BEING ROOTED IN YESTERDAY'S COLONIAL RHETORIC ABOUT A WHITE MANS BURDEN TO SAVE THE BROWN MAN FROM HIMSELF AND MAYBE EVEN CIVILIZED OF IT 
tst2013.talkid1539_014 BUT DOING THESE THINGS AND THEY CAN GET YOU IN JAIL THEY CAN AND THEY CAN BE MISUNDERSTOOD MISINTERPRETED 
tst2013.talkid1539_015 BUT I DO THEM BECAUSE I HAVE TO BECAUSE THE GEOGRAPHY OF SELF MANDATES IT 
tst2013.talkid1539_016 THAT IS MY BURDEN WHAT'S YOURS 
tst2013.talkid1539_017 
tst2013.talkid1541_000 I'M A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET DOWN ANY LEGAL MINE SHAFT IN GHANA 
tst2013.talkid1541_001 THE AIR IS THICK WITH HEAT AND DUST AND IT'S HARD TO BREED 
tst2013.talkid1541_002 I CAN FEEL THE BRUSH OF SWEATY BODIES PASSING ME IN THE DARKNESS BUT I CAN'T SEEM MUCH ELSE 
tst2013.talkid1541_003 I HEAR VOICES TALKING BUT MOSTLY THE SHAFT IS THIS PER CAR FUNNY OF MEN COUGHING AND STONE BEING BROKEN WITH PRIMITIVE TOOLS 
tst2013.talkid1541_004 LIKE THE OTHERS I WEAR A FLICKERING CHEAP FLASHLIGHT TIED TO MY HEAD WITH THIS ELASTIC TATTERED BAND AND I CAN BARELY MAKE OUT THE SLICK TREE LIMBS HOLDING UP THE WALLS OF THE THREE FOOT SQUARE WHOLE DROPPING HUNDREDS OF FEET INTO THE EARTH 
tst2013.talkid1541_005 WHEN MY HAND SLIPS I SUDDENLY REMEMBER A MINOR I HAD MET DAYS BEFORE WHO HAD LOST HIS GRIP AND FELL COUNTLESS FEET DOWN THAT SHAFT 
tst2013.talkid1541_006 AS I STAND TALKING TO YOU TODAY THESE MEN ARE STILL DEEP IN THAT HOLE RISKING THEIR LIVES WITHOUT PAYMENT OR COMPENSATION AND OFTEN DYING 
tst2013.talkid1541_007 I GOT TO CLIMB OUT OF THAT HOLE AND I GOT TO GO HOME BUT THEY LIKELY NEVER WILL BECAUSE THEY ARE TRAPPED IN SLAVERY 
tst2013.talkid1541_008 FOR THE LAST TWENTY EIGHT YEARS I'VE BEEN DOCUMENTING INDIGENOUS CULTURES IN MORE THAN SEVENTY COUNTRIES ON SIX CONTINENTS AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE I HAD THE GREAT HONOR OF BEING THE SOLE EXHIBITOR AT THE VANCOUVER PEACE SUMMIT 
tst2013.talkid1541_009 AMONGST ALL THE ASTONISHING PEOPLE I MET THERE I MET OF A SUPPORTER OF FREE THE SLAVES AN N GEO DEDICATED TO ERADICATING MODERN DAY SLAVERY 
tst2013.talkid1541_010 WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT SLAVERY AND REALLY I STARTED LEARNING ABOUT SLAVERY FRIED CERTAINLY KNOWN IT EXISTED IN THE WORLD BUT NOT TO SUCH A DEGREE 
tst2013.talkid1541_011 AFTER WE FINISHED TALKING I FELT SO HORRIBLE AND HONESTLY ASHAMED AT MY OWN LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF THIS ATROCITY IN MY OWN LIFETIME AND I THOUGHT IF I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE DON'T KNOW 
tst2013.talkid1541_012 IT STARTED BURNING A HOLE IN MY STOMACH SO WITHIN WEEKS I FLEW DOWN TO LOS ANGELES TO MEET WITH THE DIRECTOR OF FREE THE SLAVES AND OFFER THEM MY HELP 
tst2013.talkid1541_013 THUS BEGAN MY JOURNEY INTO MODERN DAY SLAVERY 
tst2013.talkid1541_014 ODDLY I HAD BEEN TO MANY OF THESE PLACES BEFORE 
tst2013.talkid1541_015 SOME EVEN CONSIDERED LIKE MY SECOND HOME 
tst2013.talkid1541_016 BUT THIS TIME I WOULD SEE THE SKELETONS HIDDEN IN THE CLOSET 
tst2013.talkid1541_017 A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE TELLS US THERE ARE MORE THAN TWENTY SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE ENSLAVED IN THE WORLD TODAY 
tst2013.talkid1541_018 THAT 'S DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE TAKEN FROM AFRICA DURING THE ENTIRE TRANSATLANTIC SLAVE TRADE 
tst2013.talkid1541_019 ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO AND AGRICULTURAL SLAVE COST ABOUT THREE TIMES THE ANNUAL SALARY OF AN AMERICAN WORKER 
tst2013.talkid1541_020 THAT EQUATES TO ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TODAYS MONEY 
tst2013.talkid1541_021 IT TODAY ENTIRE FAMILIES CAN BE ENSLAVED FOR GENERATIONS OVER A DEBT AS SMALL AS EIGHTEEN DOLLARS 
tst2013.talkid1541_022 ASTONISHINGLY SLAVERY GENERATES PROFITS OF MORE THAN THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS WORLDWIDE EACH YEAR 
tst2013.talkid1541_023 MANY HAVE BEEN TRICKED BY FALSE PROMISES OF A GOOD EDUCATION A BETTER JOB ONLY TO FIND THAT THERE ARE FORCED TO WORK WITHOUT PAY UNDER THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE AND THEY CANNOT WALK AWAY 
tst2013.talkid1541_024 TODAY SLAVERY IS ABOUT COMMERCE SO THE GOODS THAT IN SLAVED PEOPLE PRODUCE HAVE VALUE BUT THE PEOPLE PRODUCING THEM OR DISPOSABLE 
tst2013.talkid1541_025 SLAVERY EXISTS EVERYWHERE NEARLY IN THE WORLD AND YET IT IS ILLEGAL EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD 
tst2013.talkid1541_026 IN INDIA NEPAL I WAS INTRODUCED TO THE BRICK KILNS 
tst2013.talkid1541_027 THE STRANGE AND AWESOME SIGHT WAS LIKE WALKING INTO ANCIENT EGYPT OR DANTE 'S INFERNO 
tst2013.talkid1541_028 ENVELOPED IN TEMPERATURES OF ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY DEGREES MEN WOMEN CHILDREN ENTIRE FAMILIES IN FACT WERE CLOAKED IN A HEAVY BLANKET OF DUST WHILE MECHANICALLY STACKING BRICKS ON THEIR HEAD UP TO EIGHTEEN AT A TIME AND CARRYING THEM FROM THE SCORCHING KILNS TO TRUCKS HUNDREDS OF YARDS AWAY 
tst2013.talkid1541_029 DEADENED BY MONOTONY AND EXHAUSTION THEY WORK SILENTLY DOING THIS TASK OVER AND OVER FOR SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN HOURS A DAY 
tst2013.talkid1541_030 THERE WERE NO BREAKS FOR FOOD NO WATER BREAKS AND THE SEVERE DEHYDRATION MADE URINATING PRETTY MUCH INCONSEQUENTIAL 
tst2013.talkid1541_031 SO PERVASIVE WAS THE HEAT AND THE DUST THAT MY CAMERA BECAME TOO HARD TO EVEN TOUCH AND CEASED WORKING 
tst2013.talkid1541_032 EVERY TWENTY MINUTES I HAVE TO RUN BACK TO OUR CRUISER TO CLEAN OUT MY GEAR AND RUN IT UNDER AN AIR CONDITIONER TO REVIVE IT AND AS I SAT THERE I THOUGHT MY CAMERA IS GETTING FAR BETTER TREATMENT THAN THESE PEOPLE 
tst2013.talkid1541_033 BACK IN THE KILNS I WANTED TO CRY BUT THE ABOLITIONIST NEXT TO ME QUICKLY GRABBED ME AND HE SAID LISA DON'T DO THAT JUST DON 'T DO THAT HERE 
tst2013.talkid1541_034 AND HE VERY CLEARLY EXPLAINED TO ME THAT EMOTIONAL DISPLAYS ARE VERY DANGEROUS AND A PLACE LIKE THIS NOT JUST FOR ME BUT FOR THEM 
tst2013.talkid1541_035 I COULDN'T OFFER THEM ANY DIRECT HELP 
tst2013.talkid1541_036 I COULDN 'T GIVE THEM MONEY NOTHING 
tst2013.talkid1541_037 I WASN'T A CITIZEN OF THAT COUNTRY 
tst2013.talkid1541_038 I COULD GET THEM IN A WORSE SITUATION THAN THEY WERE ALREADY IN 
tst2013.talkid1541_039 I HAVE TO RELY ON FREE THE SLAVES TO WORK WITH IN THE SYSTEM FOR THEIR LIBERATION AND I TRUSTED THAT THEY WOULD 
tst2013.talkid1541_040 AS FOR ME I HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL I GOT HOME TO REALLY FEEL BY HEARTBREAK 
tst2013.talkid1541_041 IN THE HIMALAYAS I FOUND CHILDREN CARRYING STONE FOR MILES DOWN MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN TO TRUCKS WAITING AT ROADS BELOW 
tst2013.talkid1541_042 THE BIG SHEETS OF SLATE WERE HEAVIER THAN THE CHILDREN CARRYING THEM AND THE KIDS HOISTED THEM FROM THEIR HEADS USING THESE HANDMADE HARNESSES OF STICKS AND ROPE AND TORN CLOTH 
tst2013.talkid1541_043 IT'S DIFFICULT TO WITNESS SOMETHING SO OVERWHELMING 
tst2013.talkid1541_044 HOW CAN WE EFFECT SOMETHING SO INSIDIOUS YET SO PERVASIVE 
tst2013.talkid1541_045 SOME DON'T EVEN KNOW THEIR ENSLAVED PEOPLE WORKING SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN HOURS A DAY WITHOUT ANY PAY BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN THE CASE ALL THEIR LIVES 
tst2013.talkid1541_046 THEY HAVE NOTHING TO COMPARE IT TO 
tst2013.talkid1541_047 WHEN THESE VILLAGERS CLAIMED THEIR FREEDOM THE SLAVEHOLDERS BURNED DOWN ALL OF THEIR HOUSES 
tst2013.talkid1541_048 I MEAN THESE PEOPLE HAD NOTHING AND THEY WERE SO PETRIFIED THEY WANTED TO GIVE UP BUT THE WOMAN IN THE CENTER RALLIED FOR THEM TO PERSEVERE AND ABOLITIONISTS ON THE GROUND HELPED THEM GET A QUARRY LEASE OF THEIR OWN SO THAT NOW THEY DO THE SAME BACK BREAKING WORK BUT THEY DO IT FOR THEMSELVES AND THEY GET PAID FOR IT AND THEY DO IT IN FREEDOM 
tst2013.talkid1541_049 SEX TRAFFICKING IS WHAT WE OFTEN THINK OF WHEN WE HEAR THE WORD SLAVERY AND BECAUSE OF THIS WORLDWIDE AWARENESS I WAS WARNED THAT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO WORK SAFELY WITHIN THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY 
tst2013.talkid1541_050 AND KATMANDU I WAS ESCORTED BY WOMEN WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN SEX SLAVES THEMSELVES 
tst2013.talkid1541_051 THEY ASSURED ME DOWN A NARROW SET OF STAIRS THAT LED TO THIS DIRTY DIMLY FLUORESCENT LIT BASEMENT 
tst2013.talkid1541_052 THIS WASN'T A BROTHEL PER SE 
tst2013.talkid1541_053 IT WAS MORE LIKE A RESTAURANT 
tst2013.talkid1541_054 CABIN RESTAURANTS AS THEY'RE KNOWN IN THE TRADE ARE VENUES FOR FORCED PROSTITUTION 
tst2013.talkid1541_055 EACH HAS SMALL PRIVATE ROOMS WHERE THE SLAVES WOMEN ALONG WITH YOUNG GIRLS AND BOYS SOME AS YOUNG AS SEVEN YEARS OLD ARE FORCED TO ENTERTAIN THE CLIENTS ENCOURAGING THEM TO BUY MORE FOOD AND ALCOHOL 
tst2013.talkid1541_056 EACH CUBICLE IS DOG AND DINGY IDENTIFIED WITH A PAINTED NUMBER ON THE WALL AND PARTITIONED BY PLYWOOD AND A CURTAIN 
tst2013.talkid1541_057 THE WORKERS HERE OFTEN ENDURE TRAGIC SEXUAL ABUSE AT THE HANDS OF THEIR CUSTOMERS 
tst2013.talkid1541_058 STANDING IN THE NEAR DARKNESS I REMEMBER FEELING THIS QUICK HOT FEAR AND IN THAT INSTANT I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT IT MUST BE LIKE TO BE TRAPPED IN THAT HELL 
tst2013.talkid1541_059 I HAD ONLY ONE WAY OUT THE STAIRS FROM WHERE I'D COME IN 
tst2013.talkid1541_060 THERE WERE NO BACK DOORS 
tst2013.talkid1541_061 THERE WERE NO WINDOWS LARGE ENOUGH TO CLIMB THROUGH 
tst2013.talkid1541_062 THESE PEOPLE HAVE NO ESCAPE AT ALL AND AS WE TAKE IN SUCH A DIFFICULT SUBJECT IT 'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT SLAVERY INCLUDING SEX TRAFFICKING OCCURS IN OUR OWN BACKYARD AS WELL 
tst2013.talkid1541_063 TENS OF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ARE ENSLAVED IN AGRICULTURE IN RESTAURANTS IN DOMESTIC SERVITUDE AND THE LIST CAN GO ON 
tst2013.talkid1541_064 RECENTLY THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTED THAT BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND AMERICAN CHILDREN ARE SOLD INTO SEX SLAVERY EVERY YEAR 
tst2013.talkid1541_065 IT 'S ALL AROUND US WE JUST DON'T SEE 
tst2013.talkid1541_066 THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY IS ANOTHER ONE WE OFTEN THINK OF WHEN WE HEAR ABOUT SLAVE LABOR 
tst2013.talkid1541_067 I VISITED VILLAGES IN INDIA WHERE ENTIRE FAMILIES WERE ENSLAVED IN THE SILK TRADE 
tst2013.talkid1541_068 THIS IS A FAMILY PORTRAIT 
tst2013.talkid1541_069 THE DYED BLACK HANDS ARE THE FATHER WHILE THE BLUE AND RED HANDS ARE HIS SONS 
tst2013.talkid1541_070 THEY MAKES DIE IN THESE BIG BARRELS AND THEY SUBMERGED THE SILK INTO THE LIQUID UP TO THEIR ELBOWS BUT THE DIE IS TOXIC 
tst2013.talkid1541_071 MY INTERPRETER TOLD ME THEIR STORIES 
tst2013.talkid1541_072 WE HAVE NO FREEDOM THEY SAID 
tst2013.talkid1541_073 WE HOPE STILL THOUGH THAT WE COULD LEAVE THIS HOUSE SOMEDAY AND GO SOMEPLACE ELSE WHERE WE ACTUALLY GET PAID FOR ARE DYING 
tst2013.talkid1541_074 IT 'S ESTIMATED THAT MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND CHILDREN ARE ENSLAVED ON LAKE VOLTA THE LARGEST MAN MADE LAKE IN THE WORLD 
tst2013.talkid1541_075 WHEN WE FIRST ARRIVED I WANT TO HAVE A QUICK LOOK 
tst2013.talkid1541_076 I SAW WHAT SEEMED TO BE A FAMILY FISHING ON A BOAT TO OLDER BROTHERS SOME YOUNGER KIDS MAKES SENSE RIGHT 
tst2013.talkid1541_077 WRONG THEY WERE ALL ENSLAVED 
tst2013.talkid1541_078 CHILDREN ARE TAKEN FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND TRAFFICKED AND VANISHED AND THEIR FORCED TO WORK ENDLESS HOURS ON THESE BOATS ON THE LAKE EVEN THOUGH THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO SWIM 
tst2013.talkid1541_079 THIS YOUNG CHILD IS EIGHT YEARS OLD 
tst2013.talkid1541_080 HE WAS TREMBLING WHEN OUR BOAT APPROACHED FRIGHTENED IT WOULD RUN OVER HIS TINY CANOE 
tst2013.talkid1541_081 HE WAS PETRIFIED HE WOULD BE KNOCKED IN THE WATER 
tst2013.talkid1541_082 THE SKELETAL TREE LIMBS SUBMERGED IN LAKE VOLTA OFTEN CATCH THE FISHING NETS AND WEARY FRIGHTENED CHILDREN ARE THROWN INTO THE WATER TO AND HAVE ALLIANCE 
tst2013.talkid1541_083 MANY OF THEM TRAM 
tst2013.talkid1541_084 FOR AS LONG AS HE CAN RECALL HE 'S BEEN FORCED TO WORK ON THE LAKE 
tst2013.talkid1541_085 TERRIFIED OF HIS MASTER HE WILL NOT RUN AWAY AND SINCE HE 'S BEEN TREATED WITH CRUELTY ALL HIS LIFE HE PASSES THAT DOWN TO THE YOUNGER SLAVES THAT HE MANAGES 
tst2013.talkid1541_086 I MET THESE BOYS AT FIVE IN THE MORNING WHEN THEY WERE HAULING IN THE LAST OF THEIR NETS BUT THEY HAD BEEN WORKING SINCE ONE AM 
tst2013.talkid1541_087 IN THE COLD WINDY NIGHT 
tst2013.talkid1541_088 AND IT 'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THESE NETS WEIGH MORE THAN A THOUSAND POUNDS WHEN THEREFORE FISH 
tst2013.talkid1541_089 I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO KOFI 
tst2013.talkid1541_090 KOFI WAS RESCUED FROM A FISHING VILLAGE 
tst2013.talkid1541_091 I MET HIM AT A SHELTER WHERE FREE THE SLAVES REHABILITATES VICTIMS OF SLAVERY 
tst2013.talkid1541_092 HERE HE SEEMED TAKING A BATH AT THE WELL POURING BIG BUCKETS OF WATER OVER HIS HEAD AND THE WONDERFUL NEWS IS AS YOU AND I ARE SITTING HERE TALKING TODAY KOFI HAS BEEN REUNITED WITH HIS FAMILY AND WHAT'S EVEN BETTER HIS FAMILY HAS BEEN GIVEN TOOLS TO MAKE A LIVING AND TO KEEP THEIR CHILDREN SAFE 
tst2013.talkid1541_093 KOFI IS THE EMBODIMENT OF POSSIBILITY 
tst2013.talkid1541_094 WHO WILL HE BECOME BECAUSE SOMEONE TOOK A STAND AND MADE A DIFFERENCE IN HIS LIFE 
tst2013.talkid1541_095 DRIVING DOWN A ROAD IN GHANA WITH PARTNERS OF FREE THE SLAVES A FELLOW ABOLITIONIST ON A MOPEDS SUDDENLY SPED UP TO OUR CRUISER UNTAPPED ON THE WINDOW 
tst2013.talkid1541_096 HE TOLD US TO FOLLOW HIM DOWN A DIRT ROAD INTO THE JUNGLE 
tst2013.talkid1541_097 AT THE END OF THE ROAD HE URGED US OUT OF THE CAR AND TOLD THE DRIVER TO QUICKLY LEAVE 
tst2013.talkid1541_098 THEN HE POINTED TOWARD THIS BARELY VISIBLE FOOTPATH AND HE SAID THIS IS THE PRACTICES TO PATH GO 
tst2013.talkid1541_099 AS WE STARTED DOWN THE PATH WE PUSHED ASIDE THE VINES BLOCKING THE WAY AND AFTER ABOUT A WAR AN HOUR OF WALKING IN FOUND THAT THE TRAIL HAD BECOME FLOODED BY RECENT RAINS SO I HOISTED THE PHOTO GEAR ABOVE MY HEAD AS WE DESCENDED INTO THESE WATERS UP TO MY CHEST 
tst2013.talkid1541_100 AFTER ANOTHER TWO HOURS OF HIKING THE WINDING TRAIL ABRUPTLY ENDED AT A CLEARING AND BEFORE US WAS A MASS OF HOLES THAT COULD FIT INTO THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALL FIELD AND ALL OF THEM WERE FULL OF ENSLAVED PEOPLE LABORING 
tst2013.talkid1541_101 MANY WOMEN HAD CHILDREN STRAPPED TO THEIR BACKS WHILE THEY WERE PANNING FOR GOLD WADING IN WATER POISONED BY MERCURY 
tst2013.talkid1541_102 MERCURY IS USED IN THE EXTRACTION PROCESS 
tst2013.talkid1541_103 THESE MINERS ARE ENSLAVED IN A MINE SHAFT IN ANOTHER PART OF GHANA 
tst2013.talkid1541_104 WHEN THEY CAME OUT OF THE SHAFT THEY WERE SOAKING WET FROM THEIR OWN SWEAT 
tst2013.talkid1541_105 I REMEMBER LOOKING INTO THEIR TIRED BLOODSHOT EYES FOR MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN UNDERGROUND FOR SEVENTY TWO HOURS 
tst2013.talkid1541_106 THE SHAFTS ARE UP TO THREE HUNDRED FEET DEEP AND THEY CARRY OUT HEAVY BAGS OF STONE THAT LATER WILL BE TRANSPORTED TO ANOTHER AREA WHERE THE STONE WILL BE POUNDED SO THAT THEY CAN EXTRACT THE COLD 
tst2013.talkid1541_107 AT FIRST GLANCE THE POUNDING SITE SEEMS FULL OF POWERFUL MEN BUT WHEN WE LOOK CLOSER WE SEE SOME LESS FORTUNATE WORKING ON THE FRINGES AND CHILDREN TOO 
tst2013.talkid1541_108 ALL OF THEM ARE VICTIM TO INJURY ILLNESS AND VIOLENCE 
tst2013.talkid1541_109 IN FACT IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT THIS MUSCULAR PERSON WILL END UP LIKE THIS ONE HERE WRACKED WITH TUBERCULOSIS AND MERCURY POISONING IN JUST A FEW YEARS 
tst2013.talkid1541_110 THIS IS MY NEURO WHEN HIS FATHER DIED HIS SAMPLE TRAFFICKED HIM TO WORK WITH HIM IN THE MINES 
tst2013.talkid1541_111 WHEN HIS UNCLE DIED MANURE INHERITED HIS UNCLES DEAD WHICH FURTHER FORCED HIM INTO BEING ENSLAVED IN THE MINDS 
tst2013.talkid1541_112 WHEN I MET HIM HE HAD BEEN WORKING IN THE MINES FOR FOURTEEN YEARS AND THE LEG INJURY THAT YOU SEE HERE IS ACTUALLY FROM A MINING ACCIDENT ONE SO SEVERE DOCTORS SAY HIS LAKE SHOULD BE UPDATED 
tst2013.talkid1541_113 ON TOP OF THAT MANURE HAS TUBERCULOSIS YET HE STILL FORCED TO WORK DAY IN AND DAY OUT IN THAT MINE SHAFT 
tst2013.talkid1541_114 EVEN STILL HE HAS A DREAM THAT HE WILL BECOME FREE AND BECOME EDUCATED WITH THE HELP OF LOCAL ACTIVISTS LIKE FREE THE SLAVES AND IT'S THIS SORT OF DETERMINATION IN THE FACE OF ON IMAGINABLE ODDS THAT FILLS ME WITH COMPLETE ALL 
tst2013.talkid1541_115 I WANT TO SHINE A LIGHT ON SLAVERY 
tst2013.talkid1541_116 WHEN I WAS WORKING IN THE FIELD I BROUGHT LOTS OF CANDLES WITH ME AND WITH THE HELP OF MY INTERPRETER I IMPARTED TO THE PEOPLE I WAS PHOTOGRAPHING THAT I WANTED TO ILLUMINATED THEIR STORIES AND THEIR PLIGHT SO WHEN IT WAS SAFE FOR THEM AND SAY FOR ME I MADE THESE IMAGES 
tst2013.talkid1541_117 THEY KNEW THEIR IMAGE WOULD BE SEEN BY YOU OUT IN THE WORLD 
tst2013.talkid1541_118 I WANTED THEM TO KNOW THAT WE WILL BE BEARING WITNESS TO THEM AND THAT WE WILL DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO HELP MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THEIR LIVES 
tst2013.talkid1541_119 I TRULY BELIEVE IF WE CAN SEE ONE ANOTHER AS FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS THEN IT BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT TO TOLERATE ATROCITIES LIKE SLAVERY 
tst2013.talkid1541_120 THESE IMAGES ARE NOT OF ISSUES THEY ARE OF PEOPLE REAL PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME ALL DESERVING OF THE SAME RIGHTS DIGNITY AND RESPECT IN THEIR LIVES 
tst2013.talkid1541_121 THERE IS NOT A DAY THAT GOES BY THAT I DON'T THINK OF THESE MANY BEAUTIFUL MISTREATED PEOPLE I'VE HAD THE TREMENDOUS HONOR OF MEETING 
tst2013.talkid1541_122 I HOPE THAT THESE IMAGES AWAKEN A FORCE IN THOSE WHO VIEW THEM PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND I HOPE THAT FORCE WILL IGNITE A FIRE AND THAT FIRE OR SHINE A LIGHT ON SLAVERY FOR WITHOUT THAT LIGHT THE BEAST OF BONDAGE CAN CONTINUE TO LIVE IN THE SHADOWS 
tst2013.talkid1541_123 THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
tst2013.talkid1548_000 ONE OF MY FAVORITE WORDS IN THE WHOLE OF THE OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY IS SNOLLYGOSTER 
tst2013.talkid1548_001 JUST BECAUSE IT SOUNDS SO GOOD 
tst2013.talkid1548_002 AND WHAT SNOLLYGOSTER MEANS IS A DISHONEST POLITICIAN 
tst2013.talkid1548_003 ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A NINETEENTH CENTURY NEWSPAPER EDITOR WHO DOES TO FIND IT RATHER BETTER WHEN HE SAID A SNOLLYGOSTER IS A FELLOW WHO SEEKS OFFICE REGARDLESS OF PARTY PLATFORM OR PRINCIPLE AND WHO WHEN HE WINS GETS THERE BY THE SHEER FORCE OF MONUMENTAL TALK NOT FOR COLOR SUDDEN MESSY 
tst2013.talkid1548_004 NOW I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TALKNOPHICAL IS 
tst2013.talkid1548_005 SOMETHING TO DO WITH WORDS I ASSUME 
tst2013.talkid1548_006 BUT IT 'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WORDS AT THE CENTER OF POLITICS AND ALL POLITICIANS KNOW THEY HAVE TO TRY AND CONTROL LANGUAGE 
tst2013.talkid1548_007 IT WASN'T UNTIL FOR EXAMPLE SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE THAT THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT ALLOWED NEWSPAPERS TO REPORT THE EXACT WORDS THAT WERE SAID IN THE DEBATING CHAMBER 
tst2013.talkid1548_008 AND THIS WAS ACTUALLY ALL DOWN TO BRAVERY OF A GUY WITH EXTRAORDINARY NAME OF BRASS CROSS BREE WHO TOOK ON PARLIAMENT 
tst2013.talkid1548_009 AND HE WAS THROWN INTO THE TOWN OF LONDON IMPRISONED AND BUT HE WAS BRAVE ENOUGH IS BRAVE ENOUGH TO TAKE THEM ON AND IN THE END HAS SUCH POPULAR SUPPORT IN LONDON THAT HE WON 
tst2013.talkid1548_010 AND IT WAS ONLY A FEW YEARS LATER THAT WE HAVE THE FIRST RECORDED USE OF THE PHRASE AS BOLD AS BRASS 
tst2013.talkid1548_011 MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT 'S DOWN TO THE METAL 
tst2013.talkid1548_012 IT 'S NOT THIS DOWN TO A CAMPAIGNER FOR THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS 
tst2013.talkid1548_013 BUT TO REALLY SHOW YOU HOW WORDS AND POLITICS INTERACT I WANT TO TAKE YOU BACK TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA JUST AFTER THEIR ACHIEVED INDEPENDENCE 
tst2013.talkid1548_014 AND THEY HAD TO FACE THE QUESTION OF WHAT TO CALL GEORGE WASHINGTON THEIR LEADER 
tst2013.talkid1548_015 THEY DIDN'T KNOW 
tst2013.talkid1548_016 WHAT YOU CALL THE LEADER OF A REPUBLICAN COUNTRY 
tst2013.talkid1548_017 AND THIS WAS DEBATED IN CONGRESS FOR AGES AND AGES 
tst2013.talkid1548_018 AND THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF SUGGESTIONS ON THE TABLE WHICH MIGHT HAVE MADE IT 
tst2013.talkid1548_019 I'M SOME PEOPLE WANTED HIM TO BE CALLED CHIEF MAGISTRATE WASHINGTON AND OTHER PEOPLE HIS HIGHNESS GEORGE WASHINGTON AND OTHER PEOPLE PROTECTOR OF THE LIPPITT PROTECTOR OF THE LIBERTIES OF PEOPLE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WASHINGTON 
tst2013.talkid1548_020 NOT THAT CATCHING 
tst2013.talkid1548_021 SOME PEOPLE JUST WANTED TO CALL HIM KING 
tst2013.talkid1548_022 THEY THOUGHT IT WAS TRIED AND TESTED 
tst2013.talkid1548_023 AND THEY WEREN'T EVEN BEING MONARCHICAL THERE THEY HAD THE IDEA THAT YOU COULD BE ELECTED KING FOR FIXED TERM 
tst2013.talkid1548_024 AND YOU KNOW COULD WORK 
tst2013.talkid1548_025 AND EVERYBODY GOT INSANELY BORED ACTUALLY BECAUSE THIS DEBATE WENT ON FOR THREE WEEKS 
tst2013.talkid1548_026 I READ A DIARY OF THIS POOR SENATOR WHO JUST KEEPS COMING BACK A STILL ON THIS SUBJECT 
tst2013.talkid1548_027 AND THE REASON FOR THE DELAY IN THE BOREDOM WAS THAT THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WERE AGAINST THE SENATE 
tst2013.talkid1548_028 AS OF REPRESENTATIVES DIDN'T WANT WASHINGTON TO GET DRUNKEN POWER 
tst2013.talkid1548_029 THEY DIDN'T WANT TO CALL AND KING AND CASE THAT GAVE HIM IDEAS OR SUCCESSOR IDEAS 
tst2013.talkid1548_030 SO THEY WANT TO GIVE HIM THE HUMBLEST MEAGER SMITH PATHETIC TITLE THEY COULD THINK OF 
tst2013.talkid1548_031 AND THAT TITLE WAS PRESIDENT 
tst2013.talkid1548_032 PRESIDENT THEY DIDN'T INVENT THE TIGHT I MEAN IT EXISTED BEFORE BUT IT JUST WENT SOMEBODY WHO PRESIDES OVER A MEETING 
tst2013.talkid1548_033 IT WAS LIKE THAT THE FOREMAN OF THE JURY 
tst2013.talkid1548_034 AND IT DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MORE GRANDER THAN THE TERM FOREMAN OR OVERSEER 
tst2013.talkid1548_035 THERE WERE OCCASIONAL PRESIDENTS OF LITTLE COLONIAL COUNCILS AND BITS OF GOVERNMENT BUT IT WAS REALLY A NOTHING TITLE 
tst2013.talkid1548_036 AND THAT 'S WHY THE SENATE OBJECTED TO IT 
tst2013.talkid1548_037 THEY SAID THAT 'S RIDICULOUS YOU CAN'T CALL HIM PRESIDENT 
tst2013.talkid1548_038 THIS GUY HAS TO GO AND SIGN TREATIES AND MEET FOREIGN DIGNITARIES 
tst2013.talkid1548_039 AND WHO 'S GOING TO TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY IF YOU'VE GOT A SILLY LITTLE TITLE LIKE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
tst2013.talkid1548_040 AND AFTER THREE WEEKS OF DEBATE IN THE END THE SENATE DID NOT CAVE IN 
tst2013.talkid1548_041 INSTEAD THEY AGREED TO USE THE TITLE PRESIDENT FOR NOW BUT THEY ALSO WANTED ABSOLUTELY SET DOWN THAT THEY DIDN'T AGREE WITH IT FROM A DECENT RESPECT FOR THE OPINIONS AND PRACTICE OF CIVILIZED NATIONS WHETHER UNDER REMARK REPUBLICAN ALL MONARCHICAL FORMS OF GOVERNMENT WAS CUSTOM IT IS TO ANNEX TO THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE TITLES OF RESPECTABILITY NOT BLOODY PRESIDENT AND THAT IN THE INTERCOURSE WITH FOREIGN NATIONS IMAGINE A CITY OF THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES MAY NOT BE HAS AVOIDED BY AN APPEARANCE OF SINGULARITY I II WE DON'T LOOK LIKE BLOODY WEIRDOS 
tst2013.talkid1548_042 THEY COULDN'T THREE INTERESTING THINGS FROM THIS 
tst2013.talkid1548_043 FIRST OF ALL THIS IS MY FAVORITE IS THAT SO FAR AS I'VE EVER BEEN ABLE TO FIND OUT THE SENATE HAS NEVER FORMALLY ENDORSED THE TITLE OF PRESIDENT 
tst2013.talkid1548_044 BARACK OBAMA PRESIDENT OBAMA IS THERE ON BORROWED TIME JUST WAITING FOR THE SENATE TO SPRING INTO ACTION 
tst2013.talkid1548_045 SECOND THING YOU CAN LEARN IS THAT WHEN A GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT THIS IS A TEMPORARY MEASURE YOU CAN STILL BE WAITING TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE YEARS LATER 
tst2013.talkid1548_046 BUT THE THIRD THING YOU CAN LEARN AND THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ONE IS THE POINT I WANT TO LEAVE YOUR IS THAT THE TITLE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA DOESN 'T SOUND THAT HUMBLE AT ALL THESE DAYS DOES IT 
tst2013.talkid1548_047 SOMETHING TO DO WITH THESE SLIGHTLY OVER FIVE THOUSAND NUCLEAR WARHEADS HE HAS HIS AT HIS DISPOSAL AND THE LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND FREE TO DRONES AND ALL THAT SORT OF STUFF 
tst2013.talkid1548_048 REALITY AND HISTORY HAVE IN DOUBT THAT TITLE WITH GRAND 
tst2013.talkid1548_049 AND SO THE SENATE WON IN THE END 
tst2013.talkid1548_050 THEY GOT THEIR TITLED RESPECTABILITY 
tst2013.talkid1548_051 AND ALSO THE SENATE 'S OTHER WORRY THE APPEARANCE OF SINGULARITY WELL IT WAS A SINGULARITY BACK THEN 
tst2013.talkid1548_052 BUT NOW DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY NATIONS HAVE A PRESIDENT 
tst2013.talkid1548_053 ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN 
tst2013.talkid1548_054 ALL BECAUSE THEY WANT TO SOUND LIKE THE GUY WHO 'S GOT THE FIVE THOUSAND NUCLEAR WARHEADS ETC 
tst2013.talkid1548_055 AND SO IN THE END THE SENATE WON AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES LOST BECAUSE NOBODY 'S GOING TO FEEL THAT HUMBLE WHEN THEY'RE TOLD THAT THEY ARE NOW THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
tst2013.talkid1548_056 AND THAT 'S IMPORTANT LESSON I THINK YOU CAN TAKE AWAY IN THE ONE I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH 
tst2013.talkid1548_057 POLITICIANS TRY TO PICK WORDS NEWS WAS TO SHAPE REALITY AND CONTROL REALITY BUT IN FACT REALITY CHANGES WORDS FAR MORE THAN WORDS CAN EVER CHANGE REALITY 
tst2013.talkid1548_058 THANK YOU VERY MUCH 
tst2013.talkid1553_000 THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS THE PEOPLE AROUND US CAN HELP IMPROVE OUR LIVES 
tst2013.talkid1553_001 WE DON'T BUMP INTO EVERY NEIGHBORS SO A LOT OF WISDOM NEVER GETS PASSED ON BUT WE DO SHARE THE SAME PUBLIC SPACES 
tst2013.talkid1553_002 SO OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS I'VE TRIED WAYS TO SHARE MORE BY NEIGHBORS IN PUBLIC SPACE USING SIMPLE TOOLS LIKE STICKERS STENCILS AND CHALK 
tst2013.talkid1553_003 AND THESE PROJECTS CAME FROM QUESTIONS I HAD LIKE HOW MUCH ARE MY NEIGHBORS PAYING FOR THEIR APARTMENTS 
tst2013.talkid1553_004 HOW CAN WE LEND IN BORROW MORE THINGS WITHOUT KNOCKING ON EACH OTHER 'S DOORS AT A BAD TIME 
tst2013.talkid1553_005 HOW CAN WE SHARE MORE OF OUR MEMORIES OF OUR ABANDONED BUILDINGS AND GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF OUR LANDSCAPE 
tst2013.talkid1553_006 AND HOW CAN WE SHARE MORE OF OUR HOPES FOR VACANT STOREFRONTS SO OUR COMMUNITIES CAN REFLECT OUR NEEDS AND DREAMS TODAY 
tst2013.talkid1553_007 AND I LIVE IN NEW ORLEANS AND IN LOVE WITH NEW ORLEANS 
tst2013.talkid1553_008 MY SOUL IS ALWAYS SUED BY THE GIANT LIVE OAK TREES SHADING LOVERS DRUNKS AND DREAMERS FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS AND I TRUST A CITY THAT ALWAYS MAKES WAY FOR MUSIC 
tst2013.talkid1553_009 I FEEL LIKE EVERY TIME SOMEONE SNEEZES NEURONS AS A PARADE 
tst2013.talkid1553_010 THE CITY HAS SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ARCHITECTURE IN THE WORLD BUT IT ALSO HAS WHERE THE HIGHEST AMOUNTS OF ABANDONED PROPERTIES IN AMERICA 
tst2013.talkid1553_011 I LIVE NEAR THIS HOUSE AND I THOUGHT ABOUT HOW I COULD MAKE IT A NICE TO SPACE FOR MY NEIGHBORHOOD AND I ALSO THOUGHT ABOUT SOMETHING THAT CHANGED MY LIFE FOREVER 
tst2013.talkid1553_012 IN TWO THOUSAND LOSS AND WHEN I LOVED VERY MUCH 
tst2013.talkid1553_013 HER NAME WAS JOAN AND SHE WAS A MOTHER TO ME AND HER DEATH WAS SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED 
tst2013.talkid1553_014 AND I THOUGHT ABOUT DEATH A LOT AND THIS MADE ME FEEL DEEP GRATITUDE FOR THE TIME I'VE HAD AND I BROUGHT CLARITY TO THE THINGS THAT ARE MEANINGFUL TO MY LIFE NOW 
tst2013.talkid1553_015 BUT I STRUGGLE TO MAINTAIN THIS PERSPECTIVE MY DAILY LIFE 
tst2013.talkid1553_016 I FEEL LIKE IT 'S EASY TO GET CAUGHT UP IN THE DATA DAY AND FORGET WHAT REALLY MATTERS TO YOU 
tst2013.talkid1553_017 SO WITH HELP FROM OLD AND NEW FRIENDS I TURN A SIDE OF THIS ABANDONED HOUSE INTO A GIANT CHALKBOARD AND STENCILED IT WITH THE FILM A BLANK SENTENCE BEFORE I DIE I WANT TO SO ANYONE WALKING BY CAN PICK UP A PIECE OF CHALK REFLECT ON THEIR LIVES AND SHARE THEIR PERSONAL ASPIRATIONS AND PUBLIC SPACE 
tst2013.talkid1553_018 I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THIS EXPERIMENT BUT BY THE NEXT DAY OF THE WALL WAS ENTIRELY FILLED OUT AND IT KEPT GROWING 
tst2013.talkid1553_019 AND I LIKE TO SHARE A FEW THINGS THAT PEOPLE WROTE ON THIS WELL 
tst2013.talkid1553_020 BEFORE I DIE I WANT TO BE TRIED FOR PIRACY 
tst2013.talkid1553_021 BEFORE I DIE I WANT TO STRADDLE THE INTERNATIONAL DATE LINE 
tst2013.talkid1553_022 BEFORE I DIE I WANT TO SING FOR MILLIONS 
tst2013.talkid1553_023 BEFORE I DIE I WANT TO PLANT A TREE 
tst2013.talkid1553_024 BEFORE I DIE I WANT TO LIVE OFF THE GRID 
tst2013.talkid1553_025 BEFORE I DIE I WANT TO HOLD HER ONE MORE TIME 
tst2013.talkid1553_026 BEFORE I DIE I WANT TO BE SOMEONE 'S CAVALRY 
tst2013.talkid1553_027 BEFORE I DIE I WANT TO BE COMPLETELY MYSELF 
tst2013.talkid1553_028 AND SO THIS NEGLECTED SPACE BECAME A CONSTRUCTIVE ONE AND PEOPLES HOPES AND DREAMS MAYBE LAUGH OUT LOUD TEAR UP AND THEY CAN SOLD ME DURING MY OWN TOUGH TIMES 
tst2013.talkid1553_029 IT 'S ABOUT KNOWING YOUR NOT ALONE 
tst2013.talkid1553_030 IT'S ABOUT UNDERSTANDING OUR NEIGHBORS IN NOONAN LIGHTNING WAYS 
tst2013.talkid1553_031 IT'S ABOUT MAKING SPACE FOR REFLECTION AND CONTEMPLATION AND REMEMBERING WHAT REALLY MATTERS BOTH TO US AS WE GROW AND CHANGE 
tst2013.talkid1553_032 AND I MADE THIS LAST YEAR AND STARTED RECEIVING HUNDREDS OF MESSAGES FROM PASSIONATE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO MAKE A WALL WITH THEIR COMMUNITY SO MY CIVIC CENTER COLLEAGUES AND I MADE A TOOL KIT AND NOW ALSO BEEN MADE IN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING KAZAKHSTAN SOUTH AFRICA AUSTRALIA ARGENTINA AND BEYOND 
tst2013.talkid1553_033 TOGETHER WE 'VE SHOWN HOW POWERFUL OUR PUBLIC SPACES CAN BE IF WERE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A VOICE IN SHARE MORE WITH ONE ANOTHER 
tst2013.talkid1553_034 TO THE MOST VALUABLE THINGS WE HAVE OUR TIME IN OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER PEOPLE 
tst2013.talkid1553_035 IN OUR AGE OF INCREASING DISTRACTIONS IT 'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER TO FIND WAYS TO MAINTAIN PERSPECTIVE AND REMEMBER THAT LIFE IS BRIEF AND TENDER 
tst2013.talkid1553_036 DEATH IS SOMETHING THAT WERE OFTEN DISCOURAGED TO TALK ABOUT EVEN THINK ABOUT BUT I REALIZED THAT PREPARING FOR DEATH IS ONE OF THE MOST EMPOWERING THINGS YOU CAN DO 
tst2013.talkid1553_037 THINKING ABOUT DEATH CLARIFIES YOUR LIFE 
tst2013.talkid1553_038 OUR SHARED SPACES CAN BETTER REFLECT WHAT MATTERS TO US AS INDIVIDUALS AND AS A COMMUNITY AND WITH MORE WAYS TO SHARE HOPES FEARS AND STORIES THAT PEOPLE AROUND US CAN NOT ONLY HELP US MAKE BETTER PLACES THEY CAN HELP US LEAD BETTER LIVES 
tst2013.talkid1553_039 
tst2013.talkid1553_040 THANK YOU 
tst2013.talkid1592_000 FIVE YEARS AGO I EXPERIENCED A BIT OF WHAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE TO BE ALICE IN WONDERLAND 
tst2013.talkid1592_001 PENN STATE ASKED ME A COMMUNICATIONS TEACHER TO TEACH A COMMUNICATIONS CLASS FOR ENGINEERING STUDENTS 
tst2013.talkid1592_002 AND I WAS SCARED 
tst2013.talkid1592_003 REALLY SCARED SCARED OF THESE STUDENTS WITH THEIR BIG BRAINS AND THEIR BIG BOOKS AND THEIR BIG UNFAMILIAR WORDS 
tst2013.talkid1592_004 BUT AS THESE CONVERSATIONS UNFOLDED I EXPERIENCE WHAT ALICE MUST HAVE WHEN SHE WENT DOWN THAT RABBIT HOLE AND SAW THAT DOOR TO A WHOLE NEW WORLD 
tst2013.talkid1592_005 THAT 'S JUST HOW I FELT AS I HAD THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE STUDENTS I WAS AMAZED AT THE IDEAS THAT THEY THAT THEY HAD AND I WANTED OTHERS TO EXPERIENCE THIS WONDERLAND AS WELL 
tst2013.talkid1592_006 AND I BELIEVE THE KEY TO OPENING THAT DOOR IS GREAT COMMUNICATION 
tst2013.talkid1592_007 WE DESPERATELY NEED GREAT COMMUNICATION FROM OUR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS IN ORDER TO CHANGE THE WORLD 
tst2013.talkid1592_008 OUR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE TACKLING OUR GRANDEST CHALLENGES FROM ENERGY TO ENVIRONMENT TO HEALTH CARE AMONG OTHERS AND IF WE DON 'T KNOW ABOUT IT AND UNDERSTAND IT THEN THE WORK ISN'T DONE AND I BELIEVE IT 'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS NON SCIENTISTS TO HAVE THESE INTERACTIONS 
tst2013.talkid1592_009 BUT THESE GREAT CONVERSATIONS CAN'T OCCUR IF OUR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS DON'T INVITE US IN TO SEE THEIR WONDERLAND 
tst2013.talkid1592_010 SO SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS PLEASE TALK NERDY TO US 
tst2013.talkid1592_011 I WANT TO SHARE A FEW KEYS ON HOW YOU CAN DO THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN SEE THAT YOUR SCIENCE IS SEXY AND THAT YOUR ENGINEERING IS ENGAGING 
tst2013.talkid1592_012 FIRST QUESTION TO ANSWER FOR US SO WHAT 
tst2013.talkid1592_013 TELL US WHY YOUR SCIENCE IS RELEVANT TO US 
tst2013.talkid1592_014 DON 'T JUST TELL ME THAT YOU STUDY TRABECULAE WAY BUT TELL ME THAT YOU STUDY TRABECULAE WHICH IS THE MESH LIKE STRUCTURE OF OUR BONES BECAUSE IT 'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTANDING AND TREATING OSTEOPOROSIS 
tst2013.talkid1592_015 AND WHEN YOU'RE DESCRIBING YOUR SCIENCE BEWARE OF JARGON 
tst2013.talkid1592_016 JARGON IS A BARRIER TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR IDEAS 
tst2013.talkid1592_017 SURE YOU CAN SAY SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL BUT WHEN I JUST SAY SPACE AND TIME WHICH IS SO MUCH MORE ACCESSIBLE TO US 
tst2013.talkid1592_018 AND MAKING YOUR IDEAS ACCESSIBLE IS NOT THE SAME AS DUMBING IT DOWN 
tst2013.talkid1592_019 INSTEAD AS EINSTEIN SAID MAKE EVERYTHING AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE BUT NO SIMPLER 
tst2013.talkid1592_020 YOU CAN CLEARLY COMMUNICATE YOUR SCIENCE WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE IDEAS 
tst2013.talkid1592_021 A FEW THINGS TO CONSIDER ARE HAVING EXAMPLES STORIES ANALOGIES THOSE ARE WAYS TO ENGAGE AND EXCITE US ABOUT YOUR CONTENT 
tst2013.talkid1592_022 AND WHEN PRESENTING YOUR WORK DROP THE BULLET POINTS 
tst2013.talkid1592_023 HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHY THEY'RE CALLED BULLET POINTS 
tst2013.talkid1592_024 WHAT DO BULLETS DO BULLETS KILL AND THEY WILL KILL YOUR PRESENTATION 
tst2013.talkid1592_025 A SLIDE LIKE THIS IS NOT ONLY BORING BUT IT RELIES TOO MUCH ON THE LANGUAGE AREA OF OUR BRAIN AND CAUSES US TO BECOME OVERWHELMED 
tst2013.talkid1592_026 INSTEAD THIS EXAMPLE SLIDE BY GENEVIEVE BROWN IS MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE IT 'S SHOWING THAT THE SPECIAL STRUCTURE OF TRABECULAE ARE SO STRONG THAT THEY ACTUALLY INSPIRED THE UNIQUE DESIGN OF THE EIFFEL TOWER 
tst2013.talkid1592_027 AND THE TRICK HERE IS TO USE A SINGLE READABLE SENTENCE THAT THE AUDIENCE CAN KEY INTO IF THEY GET A BIT LOST AND THEN PROVIDE VISUALS WHICH APPEAL TO OUR OTHER SENSES AND CREATE A DEEPER SENSE OF UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S BEING DESCRIBED 
tst2013.talkid1592_028 SO I THINK THESE ARE JUST A FEW KEYS THAT CAN HELP THE REST OF US TO OPEN THAT DOOR AND SEE THE WONDERLAND THAT IS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING 
tst2013.talkid1592_029 AND BECAUSE THE ENGINEERS THAT I'VE WORKED WITH HAVE TAUGHT ME TO BECOME REALLY IN TOUCH WITH MY INNER NERD I WANT TO SUMMARIZE WITH AN EQUATION 
tst2013.talkid1592_030 TAKE YOUR SCIENCE SUBTRACT YOUR BULLET POINTS AND YOUR JARGON DIVIDE BY RELEVANCE MEANING SHARE WHAT'S RELEVANT TO THE AUDIENCE AND MULTIPLY BY THE PASSION THAT YOU HAVE FOR THIS INCREDIBLE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING AND THAT IS GOING TO EQUAL INCREDIBLE INTERACTIONS THAT ARE FULL OF UNDERSTANDING 
tst2013.talkid1592_031 AND SO SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS WHEN YOU'VE SOLVE THIS EQUATION BY ALL MEANS TALK NERDY TO ME 
tst2013.talkid1592_032
