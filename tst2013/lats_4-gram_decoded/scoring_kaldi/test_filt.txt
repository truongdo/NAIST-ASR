tst2013.talkid1518_000 HI THIS IS MY MOBILE PHONE
tst2013.talkid1518_001 A MOBILE PHONE CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE AND A MOBILE PHONE GIVES YOU INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM
tst2013.talkid1518_002 WITH A MOBILE PHONE YOU CAN SHOOT A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY IN SYRIA
tst2013.talkid1518_003 WITH A MOBILE PHONE YOU CAN TWEET A MESSAGE AND START A PROTEST IN EGYPT
tst2013.talkid1518_004 AND WITH A MOBILE PHONE YOU CAN RECORD A SONG LOAD IT UP TO SOUNDCLOUD AND BECOME FAMOUS
tst2013.talkid1518_005 ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE WITH YOUR MOBILE PHONE
tst2013.talkid1518_006 I'M A CHILD OF NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND I LIVE IN THE CITY OF BERLIN
tst2013.talkid1518_007 LET'S GO BACK TO THAT TIME TO THIS CITY
tst2013.talkid1518_008 HERE YOU CAN SEE HOW HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE STOOD UP AND PROTESTED FOR CHANGE
tst2013.talkid1518_009 THIS IS AUTUMN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE AND IMAGINE THAT ALL THOSE PEOPLE STANDING UP AND PROTESTING FOR CHANGE HAD A MOBILE PHONE IN THEIR POCKET
tst2013.talkid1518_010 WHO IN THE ROOM HAS A MOBILE PHONE WITH YOU
tst2013.talkid1518_011 HOLD IT UP
tst2013.talkid1518_012 HOLD YOUR PHONES UP HOLD YOUR PHONES UP
tst2013.talkid1518_013 HOLD IT UP AN ANDROID A BLACKBERRY WOW
tst2013.talkid1518_014 THAT'S A LOT ALMOST EVERYBODY TODAY HAS A MOBILE PHONE
tst2013.talkid1518_015 BUT TODAY I WILL TALK ABOUT ME AND MY MOBILE PHONE AND HOW IT CHANGED MY LIFE
tst2013.talkid1518_016 AND I WILL TALK ABOUT THIS
tst2013.talkid1518_017 THESE ARE THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY LINES OF INFORMATION
tst2013.talkid1518_018 RAW DATA
tst2013.talkid1518_019 AND WHY ARE THESE INFORMATIONS THERE
tst2013.talkid1518_020 BECAUSE IN THE SUMMER OF TWO THOUSAND SIX THE EU COMMISSION TABLED A DIRECTIVE
tst2013.talkid1518_021 THIS DIRECTIVE IS CALLED DATA RETENTION DIRECTIVE
tst2013.talkid1518_022 THIS DIRECTIVE SAYS THAT EACH PHONE COMPANY IN EUROPE EACH INTERNET SERVICE COMPANY ALL OVER EUROPE HAS TO STORE A WIDE RANGE OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE USERS
tst2013.talkid1518_023 WHO CALLS WHOM WHO SENDS WHOM AN EMAIL
tst2013.talkid1518_024 WHO SENDS WHOM A TEXT MESSAGE
tst2013.talkid1518_025 AND IF YOU USE YOUR MOBILE PHONE WHERE YOU ARE
tst2013.talkid1518_026 ALL THESE INFORMATION ARE STORED FOR AT LEAST SIX MONTHS UP TO TWO YEARS BY YOUR PHONE COMPANY OR YOUR INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER
tst2013.talkid1518_027 AND ALL OVER EUROPE PEOPLE STOOD UP AND SAID WE DON'T WANT THIS
tst2013.talkid1518_028 THEY SAID WE DON'T WANT THIS DATA RETENTION
tst2013.talkid1518_029 WE WANT SELF DETERMINATION IN THE DIGITAL AGE AND WE DON'T WANT THAT PHONE COMPANIES AND INTERNET COMPANIES HAVE TO STORE ALL THIS INFORMATION ABOUT US
tst2013.talkid1518_030 THEY WERE LAWYERS JOURNALISTS PRIESTS THEY ALL SAID WE DON'T WANT THIS
tst2013.talkid1518_031 AND HERE YOU CAN SEE LIKE TEN THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WENT OUT ON THE STREETS OF BERLIN AND SAID FREEDOM NOT FEAR
tst2013.talkid1518_032 AND SOME EVEN SAID THIS WOULD BE STASI TWO POINT OH
tst2013.talkid1518_033 STASI WAS THE SECRET POLICE IN EAST GERMANY
tst2013.talkid1518_034 AND I ALSO ASK MYSELF DOES IT REALLY WORK
tst2013.talkid1518_035 CAN THEY REALLY STORE ALL THIS INFORMATION ABOUT US
tst2013.talkid1518_036 EVERY TIME I USE MY MOBILE PHONE
tst2013.talkid1518_037 SO I ASKED MY PHONE COMPANY DEUTSCHE TELEKOM WHICH WAS AT THAT TIME THE LARGEST PHONE COMPANY IN GERMANY AND I ASKED THEM PLEASE SEND ME ALL THE INFORMATION YOU HAVE STORED ABOUT ME
tst2013.talkid1518_038 AND I ASKED THEM ONCE AND I ASKED THEM AGAIN AND I GOT NO REAL ANSWER IT WAS ONLY BLAH BLAH ANSWERS
tst2013.talkid1518_039 BUT THEN I SAID I WANT TO HAVE THIS INFORMATION BECAUSE THIS IS MY LIFE YOU ARE PROTOCOLING
tst2013.talkid1518_040 SO I DECIDED TO START A LAWSUIT AGAINST THEM BECAUSE I WANTED TO HAVE THIS INFORMATION
tst2013.talkid1518_041 BUT DEUTSCHE TELEKOM SAID NO WE WILL NOT GIVE YOU THIS INFORMATION
tst2013.talkid1518_042 SO AT THE END I HAD A SETTLEMENT WITH THEM
tst2013.talkid1518_043 I'LL PUT DOWN THE LAWSUIT AND THEY WILL SEND ME ALL THE INFORMATION I ASK FOR
tst2013.talkid1518_044 BECAUSE IN THE MEANTIME THE GERMAN CONSTITUTIONAL COURT RULED THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS EU DIRECTIVE INTO GERMAN LAW WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL
tst2013.talkid1518_045 SO I GOT THIS UGLY BROWN ENVELOPE WITH A CD INSIDE
tst2013.talkid1518_046 AND ON THE CD THIS WAS ON
tst2013.talkid1518_047 THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY LINES OF INFORMATION
tst2013.talkid1518_048 AT FIRST I SAW IT AND I SAID OKAY IT'S A HUGE FILE OKAY
tst2013.talkid1518_049 BUT THEN AFTER A WHILE I REALIZED THIS IS MY LIFE
tst2013.talkid1518_050 THIS IS SIX MONTHS OF MY LIFE INTO THIS FILE
tst2013.talkid1518_051 SO I WAS A LITTLE BIT SKEPTICAL WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH IT
tst2013.talkid1518_052 BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE WHERE I AM WHERE I SLEEP AT NIGHT WHAT AM I DOING
tst2013.talkid1518_053 BUT THEN I SAID I WANT TO GO OUT WITH THIS INFORMATION
tst2013.talkid1518_054 I WANT TO MAKE THEM PUBLIC
tst2013.talkid1518_055 BECAUSE I WANT TO SHOW THE PEOPLE WHAT DOES DATA RETENTION MEAN
tst2013.talkid1518_056 SO TOGETHER WITH ZEIT ONLINE AND OPEN DATA CITY I DID THIS
tst2013.talkid1518_057 THIS IS A VISUALIZATION OF SIX MONTHS OF MY LIFE
tst2013.talkid1518_058 YOU CAN ZOOM IN AND ZOOM OUT YOU CAN WIND BACK AND FAST FORWARD
tst2013.talkid1518_059 YOU CAN SEE EVERY STEP I TAKE
tst2013.talkid1518_060 AND YOU CAN EVEN SEE HOW I GO FROM FRANKFURT BY TRAIN TO COLOGNE AND HOW OFTEN I CALL IN BETWEEN
tst2013.talkid1518_061 ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE WITH THIS INFORMATION
tst2013.talkid1518_062 THAT'S A LITTLE BIT SCARY
tst2013.talkid1518_063 BUT IT IS NOT ONLY ABOUT ME
tst2013.talkid1518_064 IT'S ABOUT ALL OF US
tst2013.talkid1518_065 FIRST IT'S ONLY LIKE I CALL MY WIFE AND SHE CALLS ME AND WE TALK TO EACH OTHER A COUPLE OF TIMES
tst2013.talkid1518_066 AND THEN THERE ARE SOME FRIENDS CALLING ME AND THEY CALL EACH OTHER
tst2013.talkid1518_067 AND AFTER A WHILE YOU ARE CALLING YOU AND YOU ARE CALLING YOU AND YOU HAVE THIS GREAT COMMUNICATION NETWORK
tst2013.talkid1518_068 BUT YOU CAN SEE HOW YOUR PEOPLE ARE COMMUNICATING WITH EACH OTHER WHAT TIMES THEY CALL EACH OTHER WHEN THEY GO TO BED
tst2013.talkid1518_069 YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THIS
tst2013.talkid1518_070 YOU CAN SEE THE HUBS LIKE WHO ARE THE LEADERS IN THE GROUP
tst2013.talkid1518_071 IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION YOU CAN SEE WHAT YOUR SOCIETY IS DOING
tst2013.talkid1518_072 IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR SOCIETY
tst2013.talkid1518_073 THIS IS A BLUEPRINT FOR COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA AND IRAN
tst2013.talkid1518_074 THIS IS A BLUEPRINT HOW TO SURVEY YOUR SOCIETY BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHO TALKS TO WHOM WHO SENDS WHOM AN EMAIL ALL THIS IS POSSIBLE IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION
tst2013.talkid1518_075 AND THIS INFORMATION IS STORED FOR AT LEAST SIX MONTHS IN EUROPE UP TO TWO YEARS
tst2013.talkid1518_076 LIKE I SAID AT THE BEGINNING IMAGINE THAT ALL THOSE PEOPLE ON THE STREETS OF BERLIN IN AUTUMN OF NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE HAD A MOBILE PHONE IN THEIR POCKET
tst2013.talkid1518_077 AND THE STASI WOULD HAVE KNOWN WHO TOOK PART AT THIS PROTEST AND IF THE STASI WOULD HAVE KNOWN WHO ARE THE LEADERS BEHIND IT THIS MAY NEVER HAVE HAPPENED
tst2013.talkid1518_078 THE FALL OF THE BERLIN WALL WOULD MAYBE NOT THERE
tst2013.talkid1518_079 AND IN THE AFTERMATH ALSO NOT THE FALL OF THE IRON CURTAIN
tst2013.talkid1518_080 BECAUSE TODAY STATE AGENCIES AND COMPANIES WANT TO STORE AS MUCH INFORMATION AS THEY CAN GET ABOUT US ONLINE AND OFFLINE
tst2013.talkid1518_081 THEY WANT TO HAVE THE POSSIBILITY TO TRACK OUR LIVES AND THEY WANT TO STORE THEM FOR ALL TIME
tst2013.talkid1518_082 BUT SELF DETERMINATION AND LIVING IN THE DIGITAL AGE IS NO CONTRADICTION
tst2013.talkid1518_083 BUT YOU HAVE TO FIGHT FOR YOUR SELF DETERMINATION TODAY
tst2013.talkid1518_084 YOU HAVE TO FIGHT FOR IT EVERY DAY
tst2013.talkid1518_085 SO WHEN YOU GO HOME TELL YOUR FRIENDS THAT PRIVACY IS A VALUE OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND IT'S NOT OUTDATED
tst2013.talkid1518_086 WHEN YOU GO HOME TELL YOUR REPRESENTATIVE ONLY BECAUSE COMPANIES AND STATE AGENCIES HAVE THE POSSIBILITY TO STORE CERTAIN INFORMATION THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO IT
tst2013.talkid1518_087 AND IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME ASK YOUR PHONE COMPANY WHAT INFORMATION THEY STORE ABOUT YOU
tst2013.talkid1518_088 SO IN THE FUTURE EVERY TIME YOU USE YOUR MOBILE PHONE LET IT BE A REMINDER TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE TO FIGHT FOR SELF DETERMINATION IN THE DIGITAL AGE
tst2013.talkid1518_089 THANK YOU
tst2013.talkid1520_000 DOC EDGERTON INSPIRED US WITH AWE AND CURIOSITY WITH THIS PHOTO OF A BULLET PIERCING THROUGH AN APPLE AN EXPOSURE JUST A MILLIONTH OF A SECOND
tst2013.talkid1520_001 BUT NOW FIFTY YEARS LATER WE CAN GO A MILLION TIMES FASTER AND SEE THE WORLD NOT AT A MILLION OR A BILLION BUT ONE TRILLION FRAMES PER SECOND
tst2013.talkid1520_002 I PRESENT YOU A NEW TYPE OF PHOTOGRAPHY FEMTO PHOTOGRAPHY A NEW IMAGING TECHNIQUE SO FAST THAT IT CAN CREATE SLOW MOTION VIDEOS OF LIGHT IN MOTION
tst2013.talkid1520_003 AND WITH THAT WE CAN CREATE CAMERAS THAT CAN LOOK AROUND CORNERS BEYOND LINE OF SIGHT OR SEE INSIDE OUR BODY WITHOUT AN X RAY AND REALLY CHALLENGE WHAT WE MEAN BY A CAMERA
tst2013.talkid1520_004 NOW IF I TAKE A LASER POINTER AND TURN IT ON AND OFF IN ONE TRILLIONTH OF A SECOND WHICH IS SEVERAL FEMTOSECONDS I'LL CREATE A PACKET OF PHOTONS BARELY A MILLIMETER WIDE AND THAT PACKET OF PHOTONS THAT BULLET WILL TRAVEL AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT AND AGAIN A MILLION TIMES FASTER THAN AN ORDINARY BULLET
tst2013.talkid1520_005 NOW IF YOU TAKE THAT BULLET AND TAKE THIS PACKET OF PHOTONS AND FIRE INTO THIS BOTTLE HOW WILL THOSE PHOTONS SHATTER INTO THIS BOTTLE
tst2013.talkid1520_006 HOW DOES LIGHT LOOK IN SLOW MOTION
tst2013.talkid1520_007 NOW THE WHOLE EVENT
tst2013.talkid1520_008 NOW REMEMBER THE WHOLE EVENT IS EFFECTIVELY TAKING PLACE IN LESS THAN A NANOSECOND THAT'S HOW MUCH TIME IT TAKES FOR LIGHT TO TRAVEL BUT I'M SLOWING DOWN IN THIS VIDEO BY A FACTOR OF TEN BILLION SO YOU CAN SEE THE LIGHT IN MOTION
tst2013.talkid1520_009 BUT COCA COLA DID NOT SPONSOR THIS RESEARCH
tst2013.talkid1520_010 NOW THERE'S A LOT GOING ON IN THIS MOVIE SO LET ME BREAK THIS DOWN AND SHOW YOU WHAT'S GOING ON
tst2013.talkid1520_011 SO THE PULSE ENTERS THE BOTTLE OUR BULLET WITH A PACKET OF PHOTONS THAT START TRAVELING THROUGH AND THAT START SCATTERING INSIDE
tst2013.talkid1520_012 SOME OF THE LIGHT LEAKS GOES ON THE TABLE AND YOU START SEEING THESE RIPPLES OF WAVES
tst2013.talkid1520_013 MANY OF THE PHOTONS EVENTUALLY REACH THE CAP AND THEN THEY EXPLODE IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS
tst2013.talkid1520_014 AS YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A BUBBLE OF AIR AND IT'S BOUNCING AROUND INSIDE
tst2013.talkid1520_015 MEANWHILE THE RIPPLES ARE TRAVELING ON THE TABLE AND BECAUSE OF THE REFLECTIONS AT THE TOP YOU SEE AT THE BACK OF THE BOTTLE AFTER SEVERAL FRAMES THE REFLECTIONS ARE FOCUSED
tst2013.talkid1520_016 NOW IF YOU TAKE AN ORDINARY BULLET AND LET IT GO THE SAME DISTANCE AND SLOW DOWN THE VIDEO AGAIN BY A FACTOR OF TEN BILLION DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG YOU'LL HAVE TO SIT HERE TO WATCH THAT MOVIE
tst2013.talkid1520_017 A DAY A WEEK ACTUALLY A WHOLE YEAR
tst2013.talkid1520_018 IT'LL BE A VERY BORING MOVIE OF A SLOW ORDINARY BULLET IN MOTION
tst2013.talkid1520_019 AND WHAT ABOUT SOME STILL LIFE PHOTOGRAPHY
tst2013.talkid1520_020 YOU CAN WATCH THE RIPPLES AGAIN WASHING OVER THE TABLE THE TOMATO AND THE WALL IN THE BACK
tst2013.talkid1520_021 IT'S LIKE THROWING A STONE IN A POND OF WATER
tst2013.talkid1520_022 I THOUGHT THIS IS HOW NATURE PAINTS A PHOTO ONE FEMTO FRAME AT A TIME BUT OF COURSE OUR EYE SEES AN INTEGRAL COMPOSITE
tst2013.talkid1520_023 BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THIS TOMATO ONE MORE TIME YOU WILL NOTICE AS THE LIGHT WASHES OVER THE TOMATO IT CONTINUES TO GLOW IT DOESN'T BECOME DARK
tst2013.talkid1520_024 WHY IS THAT BECAUSE THE TOMATO IS ACTUALLY RIPE AND THE LIGHT IS BOUNCING AROUND INSIDE THE TOMATO AND IT COMES OUT AFTER SEVERAL TRILLIONTHS OF A SECOND
tst2013.talkid1520_025 SO IN THE FUTURE WHEN THIS FEMTO CAMERA IS IN YOUR CAMERA PHONE YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO GO TO A SUPERMARKET AND CHECK IF THE FRUIT IS RIPE WITHOUT ACTUALLY TOUCHING IT
tst2013.talkid1520_026 SO HOW DID MY TEAM AT MIT CREATE THIS CAMERA
tst2013.talkid1520_027 NOW AS PHOTOGRAPHERS YOU KNOW IF YOU TAKE A SHORT EXPOSURE PHOTO YOU GET VERY LITTLE LIGHT BUT WE'RE GOING TO GO A BILLION TIMES FASTER THAN YOUR SHORTEST EXPOSURE SO YOU'RE GOING TO GET HARDLY ANY LIGHT
tst2013.talkid1520_028 SO WHAT WE DO IS WE SEND THAT BULLET THOSE PACKET OF PHOTONS MILLIONS OF TIMES AND RECORD AGAIN AND AGAIN WITH VERY CLEVER SYNCHRONIZATION AND FROM THE GIGABYTES OF DATA WE COMPUTATIONALLY WEAVE TOGETHER TO CREATE THOSE FEMTO VIDEOS I SHOWED YOU
tst2013.talkid1520_029 AND WE CAN TAKE ALL THAT RAW DATA AND TREAT IT IN VERY INTERESTING WAYS
tst2013.talkid1520_030 SO SUPERMAN CAN FLY
tst2013.talkid1520_031 SOME OTHER HEROES CAN BECOME INVISIBLE BUT WHAT ABOUT A NEW POWER FOR A FUTURE SUPERHERO TO SEE AROUND CORNERS
tst2013.talkid1520_032 THE IDEA IS THAT WE ARE GOING TO SHINE SOME LIGHT ON THE DOOR
tst2013.talkid1520_033 IT'S GOING TO BOUNCE GO INSIDE THE ROOM SOME OF THAT IS GOING TO REFLECT BACK ON THE DOOR AND THEN BACK TO THE CAMERA AND WE ARE GOING TO EXPLOIT THESE MULTIPLE BOUNCES OF LIGHT
tst2013.talkid1520_034 AND IT'S NOT SCIENCE FICTION WE HAVE ACTUALLY BUILT IT
tst2013.talkid1520_035 ON THE LEFT YOU SEE OUR FEMTO CAMERA
tst2013.talkid1520_036 THERE'S A MANNEQUIN HIDDEN BEHIND A WALL AND WE'RE GOING TO BOUNCE LIGHT OFF THE DOOR
tst2013.talkid1520_037 SO AFTER OUR PAPER WAS PUBLISHED IN NATURE COMMUNICATIONS IT WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY NATURE DOT COM AND THEY CREATED THIS ANIMATION
tst2013.talkid1520_038 WE'RE GOING TO FIRE THOSE BULLETS OF LIGHT AND THEY'RE GOING TO HIT THIS WALL AND BECAUSE THE PACKET OF THE PHOTONS THEY WILL SCATTER IN ALL THE DIRECTIONS AND SOME OF THEM WILL REACH OUR HIDDEN MANNEQUIN WHICH IN TURN WILL AGAIN SCATTER THAT LIGHT AND AGAIN IN TURN THE DOOR WILL REFLECT SOME OF THAT SCATTERED LIGHT AND A TINY FRACTION OF THE PHOTONS WILL ACTUALLY COME BACK TO THE CAMERA BUT MOST INTERESTINGLY THEY WILL ALL ARRIVE AT A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TIME SLOT
tst2013.talkid1520_039 AND BECAUSE WE HAVE A CAMERA THAT CAN RUN SO FAST OUR FEMTO CAMERA IT HAS SOME UNIQUE ABILITIES
tst2013.talkid1520_040 IT HAS VERY GOOD TIME RESOLUTION AND IT CAN LOOK AT THE WORLD AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT
tst2013.talkid1520_041 AND THIS WAY WE KNOW THE DISTANCES OF COURSE TO THE DOOR BUT ALSO TO THE HIDDEN OBJECTS BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHICH POINT CORRESPONDS TO WHICH DISTANCE
tst2013.talkid1520_042 BY SHINING ONE LASER WE CAN RECORD ONE RAW PHOTO WHICH YOU LOOK ON THE SCREEN DOESN'T REALLY MAKE ANY SENSE BUT THEN WE WILL TAKE A LOT OF SUCH PICTURES DOZENS OF SUCH PICTURES PUT THEM TOGETHER AND TRY TO ANALYZE THE MULTIPLE BOUNCES OF LIGHT AND FROM THAT CAN WE SEE THE HIDDEN OBJECT
tst2013.talkid1520_043 CAN WE SEE IT IN FULL THREE D
tst2013.talkid1520_044 SO THIS IS OUR RECONSTRUCTION
tst2013.talkid1520_045 NOW WE HAVE SOME WAYS TO GO BEFORE WE TAKE THIS OUTSIDE THE LAB ON THE ROAD BUT IN THE FUTURE WE COULD CREATE CARS THAT AVOID COLLISIONS WITH WHAT'S AROUND THE BEND OR WE CAN LOOK FOR SURVIVORS IN HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS BY LOOKING AT LIGHT REFLECTED THROUGH OPEN WINDOWS OR WE CAN BUILD ENDOSCOPES THAT CAN SEE DEEP INSIDE THE BODY AROUND OCCLUDERS AND ALSO FOR CARDIOSCOPES
tst2013.talkid1520_046 BUT OF COURSE BECAUSE OF TISSUE AND BLOOD THIS IS QUITE CHALLENGING SO THIS IS REALLY A CALL FOR SCIENTISTS TO START THINKING ABOUT FEMTO PHOTOGRAPHY AS REALLY A NEW IMAGING MODALITY TO SOLVE THE NEXT GENERATION OF HEALTH IMAGING PROBLEMS
tst2013.talkid1520_047 NOW LIKE DOC EDGERTON A SCIENTIST HIMSELF SCIENCE BECAME ART AN ART OF ULTRA FAST PHOTOGRAPHY AND I REALIZED THAT ALL THE GIGABYTES OF DATA THAT WE'RE COLLECTING EVERY TIME IS NOT JUST FOR SCIENTIFIC IMAGING BUT WE CAN ALSO DO A NEW FORM OF COMPUTATIONAL PHOTOGRAPHY WITH TIME LAPSE AND COLOR CODING AND WE LOOK AT THOSE RIPPLES REMEMBER THE TIME BETWEEN EACH OF THOSE RIPPLES IS ONLY A FEW TRILLIONTHS OF A SECOND
tst2013.talkid1520_048 BUT THERE'S ALSO SOMETHING FUNNY GOING ON HERE
tst2013.talkid1520_049 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RIPPLES UNDER THE CAP THE RIPPLES ARE MOVING AWAY FROM US
tst2013.talkid1520_050 THE RIPPLES SHOULD BE MOVING TOWARDS US
tst2013.talkid1520_051 WHAT'S GOING ON HERE
tst2013.talkid1520_052 IT TURNS OUT BECAUSE WE'RE RECORDING NEARLY AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT WE HAVE STRANGE EFFECTS AND EINSTEIN WOULD HAVE LOVED TO SEE THIS PICTURE
tst2013.talkid1520_053 THE ORDER AT WHICH EVENTS TAKE PLACE IN THE WORLD APPEAR IN THE CAMERA WITH SOMETIMES REVERSED ORDER SO BY APPLYING THE CORRESPONDING SPACE AND TIME WARP WE CAN CORRECT FOR THIS DISTORTION
tst2013.talkid1520_054 SO WHETHER IT'S FOR PHOTOGRAPHY AROUND CORNERS OR CREATING THE NEXT GENERATION OF HEALTH IMAGING OR CREATING NEW VISUALIZATIONS SINCE OUR INVENTION WE HAVE OPEN SOURCED ALL THE DATA AND DETAILS ON OUR WEBSITE AND OUR HOPE IS THAT THE DIY THE CREATIVE AND THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY WILL SHOW US THAT WE SHOULD STOP OBSESSING ABOUT THE MEGAPIXELS IN CAMERAS AND START FOCUSING ON THE NEXT DIMENSION IN IMAGING
tst2013.talkid1520_055 IT'S ABOUT TIME THANK YOU
tst2013.talkid1532_000 BEFORE MARCH TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN I WAS A PHOTOGRAPHIC RETOUCHER BASED IN NEW YORK CITY
tst2013.talkid1532_001 WE'RE PALE GRAY CREATURES
tst2013.talkid1532_002 WE HIDE IN DARK WINDOWLESS ROOMS AND GENERALLY AVOID SUNLIGHT
tst2013.talkid1532_003 WE MAKE SKINNY MODELS SKINNIER PERFECT SKIN MORE PERFECT AND THE IMPOSSIBLE POSSIBLE AND WE GET CRITICIZED IN THE PRESS ALL THE TIME BUT SOME OF US ARE ACTUALLY TALENTED ARTISTS WITH YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND A REAL APPRECIATION FOR IMAGES AND PHOTOGRAPHY
tst2013.talkid1532_004 ON MARCH ELEVENTH TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN I WATCHED FROM HOME AS THE REST OF THE WORLD DID AS THE TRAGIC EVENTS UNFOLDED IN JAPAN
tst2013.talkid1532_005 SOON AFTER AN ORGANIZATION I VOLUNTEER WITH ALL HANDS VOLUNTEERS WERE ON THE GROUND WITHIN DAYS WORKING AS PART OF THE RESPONSE EFFORTS
tst2013.talkid1532_006 I ALONG WITH HUNDREDS OF OTHER VOLUNTEERS KNEW WE COULDN'T JUST SIT AT HOME SO I DECIDED TO JOIN THEM FOR THREE WEEKS
tst2013.talkid1532_007 ON MAY THE THIRTEENTH I MADE MY WAY TO THE TOWN OF ÅFUNATO
tst2013.talkid1532_008 IT'S A SMALL FISHING TOWN IN IWATE PREFECTURE ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND PEOPLE ONE OF THE FIRST THAT WAS HIT BY THE WAVE
tst2013.talkid1532_009 THE WATERS HERE HAVE BEEN RECORDED AT REACHING OVER TWENTY FOUR METERS IN HEIGHT AND TRAVELED OVER TWO MILES INLAND
tst2013.talkid1532_010 AS YOU CAN IMAGINE THE TOWN HAD BEEN DEVASTATED
tst2013.talkid1532_011 WE PULLED DEBRIS FROM CANALS AND DITCHES
tst2013.talkid1532_012 WE CLEANED SCHOOLS WE DE MUDDED AND GUTTED HOMES READY FOR RENOVATION AND REHABILITATION
tst2013.talkid1532_013 WE CLEARED TONS AND TONS OF STINKING ROTTING FISH CARCASSES FROM THE LOCAL FISH PROCESSING PLANT
tst2013.talkid1532_014 WE GOT DIRTY AND WE LOVED IT
tst2013.talkid1532_015 FOR WEEKS ALL THE VOLUNTEERS AND LOCALS ALIKE HAD BEEN FINDING SIMILAR THINGS
tst2013.talkid1532_016 THEY'D BEEN FINDING PHOTOS AND PHOTO ALBUMS AND CAMERAS AND SD CARDS
tst2013.talkid1532_017 EVERYONE WAS DOING THE SAME
tst2013.talkid1532_018 THEY WERE COLLECTING THEM UP AND HANDING THEM IN TO VARIOUS PLACES AROUND THE DIFFERENT TOWNS FOR SAFEKEEPING
tst2013.talkid1532_019 NOW IT WASN'T UNTIL THIS POINT THAT I REALIZED THAT THESE PHOTOS WERE SUCH A HUGE PART OF THE PERSONAL LOSS THESE PEOPLE HAD FELT
tst2013.talkid1532_020 AS THEY HAD RUN FROM THE WAVE AND FOR THEIR LIVES ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING THEY HAD EVERYTHING HAD TO BE LEFT BEHIND
tst2013.talkid1532_021 AT THE END OF MY FIRST WEEK THERE I FOUND MYSELF HELPING OUT IN AN EVACUATION CENTER IN THE TOWN
tst2013.talkid1532_022 I WAS HELPING CLEAN THE ONSEN THE COMMUNAL ONSEN THE HUGE GIANT BATHTUBS
tst2013.talkid1532_023 THIS HAPPENED TO ALSO BE A PLACE IN THE TOWN WHERE THE EVACUATION CENTER WAS COLLECTING THE PHOTOS
tst2013.talkid1532_024 THIS IS WHERE PEOPLE WERE HANDING THEM IN AND I WAS HONORED THAT DAY THAT THEY ACTUALLY TRUSTED ME TO HELP THEM START HAND CLEANING THEM
tst2013.talkid1532_025 NOW IT WAS EMOTIONAL AND IT WAS INSPIRING AND I'VE ALWAYS HEARD ABOUT THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL I HAD ACTUALLY GOTTEN OUTSIDE OF MY BOX THAT SOMETHING HAPPENED
tst2013.talkid1532_026 AS I LOOKED THROUGH THE PHOTOS THERE WERE SOME WERE OVER A HUNDRED YEARS OLD SOME STILL IN THE ENVELOPE FROM THE PROCESSING LAB I COULDN'T HELP BUT THINK AS A RETOUCHER THAT I COULD FIX THAT TEAR AND MEND THAT SCRATCH AND I KNEW HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHO COULD DO THE SAME
tst2013.talkid1532_027 SO THAT EVENING I JUST REACHED OUT ON FACEBOOK AND ASKED A FEW OF THEM AND BY MORNING THE UM THE RESPONSE HAD BEEN SO OVERWHELMING AND SO POSITIVE I KNEW WE HAD TO GIVE IT A GO
tst2013.talkid1532_028 SO WE STARTED RETOUCHING PHOTOS
tst2013.talkid1532_029 THIS WAS THE VERY FIRST
tst2013.talkid1532_030 NOT TERRIBLY DAMAGED BUT WHERE THOSE THE WATER HAD CAUSED THAT DISCOLORATION ON THE GIRL'S FACE HAD TO BE REPAIRED WITH SUCH ACCURACY AND DELICACY
tst2013.talkid1532_031 OTHERWISE THAT LITTLE GIRL ISN'T GOING TO LOOK LIKE THAT LITTLE GIRL ANYMORE AND SURELY THAT'S AS TRAGIC AS HAVING THE PHOTO DAMAGED
tst2013.talkid1532_032 OVER TIME MORE PHOTOS CAME IN THANKFULLY AND MORE RETOUCHERS WERE NEEDED AND SO I REACHED OUT AGAIN ON FACEBOOK AND LINKEDIN AND WITHIN FIVE DAYS EIGHTY PEOPLE WANTED TO HELP FROM TWELVE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES
tst2013.talkid1532_033 WITHIN TWO WEEKS I HAD A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE WANTING TO JOIN IN
tst2013.talkid1532_034 WITHIN JAPAN BY JULY WE'D BRANCHED OUT TO THE NEIGHBORING TOWN OF RIKUZENTAKATA FURTHER NORTH TO A TOWN CALLED YAMADA
tst2013.talkid1532_035 ONCE A WEEK WE WOULD SET UP OUR SCANNING EQUIPMENT IN THE TEMPORARY PHOTO LIBRARIES THAT HAD BEEN SET UP WHERE PEOPLE WERE RECLAIMING THEIR PHOTOS
tst2013.talkid1532_036 THE OLDER LADIES SOMETIMES HADN'T SEEN A SCANNER BEFORE BUT WITHIN TEN MINUTES OF THEM FINDING THEIR LOST PHOTO THEY COULD GIVE IT TO US HAVE IT SCANNED UPLOADED TO A CLOUD SERVER IT WOULD BE DOWNLOADED BY A GAIJIN A STRANGER SOMEWHERE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLOBE AND IT'D START BEING FIXED
tst2013.talkid1532_037 THE TIME IT TOOK HOWEVER TO GET IT BACK IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STORY AND IT DEPENDED OBVIOUSLY ON THE DAMAGE INVOLVED
tst2013.talkid1532_038 IT COULD TAKE AN HOUR IT COULD TAKE WEEKS
tst2013.talkid1532_039 IT COULD TAKE MONTHS
tst2013.talkid1532_040 THE KIMONO IN THIS SHOT PRETTY MUCH HAD TO BE HAND DRAWN OR PIECED TOGETHER PICKING OUT THE REMAINING PARTS OF COLOR AND DETAIL THAT THE WATER HADN'T DAMAGED
tst2013.talkid1532_041 IT WAS VERY TIME CONSUMING
tst2013.talkid1532_042 NOW ALL THESE PHOTOS HAD BEEN DAMAGED BY WATER SUBMERGED IN SALT WATER COVERED IN BACTERIA IN SEWAGE SOMETIMES EVEN OIL ALL OF WHICH OVER TIME IS GOING TO CONTINUE TO DAMAGE THEM SO HAND CLEANING THEM WAS A HUGE PART OF THE PROJECT
tst2013.talkid1532_043 WE COULDN'T RETOUCH THE PHOTO UNLESS IT WAS CLEANED DRY AND RECLAIMED
tst2013.talkid1532_044 NOW WE WERE LUCKY WITH OUR HAND CLEANING
tst2013.talkid1532_045 WE HAD AN AMAZING LOCAL WOMAN WHO WHO GUIDED US
tst2013.talkid1532_046 IT'S VERY EASY TO DO MORE DAMAGE TO THOSE DAMAGED PHOTOS
tst2013.talkid1532_047 AS MY TEAM LEADER WYNNE ONCE SAID IT'S LIKE DOING A TATTOO ON SOMEONE
tst2013.talkid1532_048 YOU DON'T GET A CHANCE TO MESS IT UP
tst2013.talkid1532_049 THE LADY WHO BROUGHT US THESE PHOTOS WAS LUCKY AS FAR AS THE PHOTOS GO
tst2013.talkid1532_050 SHE HAD STARTED HAND CLEANING THEM HERSELF AND STOPPED WHEN SHE REALIZED SHE WAS DOING MORE DAMAGE
tst2013.talkid1532_051 SHE ALSO HAD DUPLICATES
tst2013.talkid1532_052 AREAS LIKE HER HUSBAND AND HER FACE WHICH OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIX WE COULD JUST PUT THEM TOGETHER IN ONE GOOD PHOTO AND REMAKE THE WHOLE PHOTO
tst2013.talkid1532_053 WHEN SHE COLLECTED THE PHOTOS FROM US SHE SHARED A BIT OF HER STORY WITH US
tst2013.talkid1532_054 HER PHOTOS WERE FOUND BY HER HUSBAND'S COLLEAGUES AT A LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT IN THE DEBRIS A LONG WAY FROM WHERE THE HOME HAD ONCE STOOD AND THEY'D RECOGNIZED HIM
tst2013.talkid1532_055 THE DAY OF THE TSUNAMI HE'D ACTUALLY BEEN IN CHARGE OF MAKING SURE THE TSUNAMI GATES WERE CLOSED
tst2013.talkid1532_056 HE HAD TO GO TOWARDS THE WATER AS THE SIRENS SOUNDED
tst2013.talkid1532_057 HER TWO LITTLE BOYS NOT SO LITTLE ANYMORE BUT HER TWO BOYS WERE BOTH AT SCHOOL SEPARATE SCHOOLS
tst2013.talkid1532_058 ONE OF THEM GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE WATER
tst2013.talkid1532_059 IT TOOK HER A WEEK TO FIND THEM ALL AGAIN AND FIND OUT THAT THEY HAD ALL SURVIVED
tst2013.talkid1532_060 THE DAY I GAVE HER THE PHOTOS ALSO HAPPENED TO BE HER YOUNGEST SON'S FOURTEENTH BIRTHDAY
tst2013.talkid1532_061 FOR HER DESPITE ALL OF THIS THOSE PHOTOS WERE THE PERFECT GIFT BACK TO HIM SOMETHING HE COULD LOOK AT AGAIN SOMETHING HE REMEMBERED FROM BEFORE THAT THAT WASN'T STILL SCARRED FROM THAT DAY IN MARCH WHEN ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING ELSE IN HIS LIFE HAD CHANGED OR BEEN DESTROYED
tst2013.talkid1532_062 AFTER SIX MONTHS IN JAPAN ELEVEN HUNDRED VOLUNTEERS HAD PASSED THROUGH ALL HANDS HUNDREDS OF WHOM HAD HELPED US HAND CLEAN OVER A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND PHOTOGRAPHS THE LARGE MAJORITY
tst2013.talkid1532_063 A LARGE MAJORITY OF WHICH DID ACTUALLY FIND THEIR HOME AGAIN IMPORTANTLY
tst2013.talkid1532_064 OVER FIVE HUNDRED VOLUNTEERS AROUND THE GLOBE HELPED US GET NINETY FAMILIES HUNDREDS OF PHOTOGRAPHS BACK FULLY RESTORED AND RETOUCHED
tst2013.talkid1532_065 DURING THIS TIME WE HADN'T REALLY SPENT MORE THAN ABOUT A THOUSAND DOLLARS IN EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS MOST OF WHICH WAS PRINTER INKS
tst2013.talkid1532_066 WE TAKE PHOTOS CONSTANTLY
tst2013.talkid1532_067 A PHOTO IS A REMINDER OF SOMEONE OR SOMETHING A PLACE A RELATIONSHIP A LOVED ONE
tst2013.talkid1532_068 THEY'RE OUR MEMORY KEEPERS AND OUR HISTORIES THE LAST THING WE WOULD GRAB AND THE FIRST THING YOU'D GO BACK TO LOOK FOR
tst2013.talkid1532_069 THAT'S ALL THIS PROJECT WAS ABOUT ABOUT RESTORING THOSE LITTLE BITS OF HUMANITY GIVING SOMEONE THAT CONNECTION BACK
tst2013.talkid1532_070 WHEN A PHOTO LIKE THIS CAN BE RETURNED TO SOMEONE LIKE THIS IT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF THE PERSON RECEIVING IT
tst2013.talkid1532_071 THE PROJECT'S ALSO MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF THE RETOUCHERS
tst2013.talkid1532_072 FOR SOME OF THEM IT'S GIVEN THEM A CONNECTION TO SOMETHING BIGGER GIVING SOMETHING BACK USING THEIR TALENTS ON SOMETHING OTHER THAN SKINNY MODELS AND PERFECT SKIN
tst2013.talkid1532_073 I WOULD LIKE TO CONCLUDE BY READING AN EMAIL I GOT FROM ONE OF THEM CINDY THE DAY I FINALLY GOT BACK FROM JAPAN AFTER SIX MONTHS
tst2013.talkid1532_074 AS I WORKED I COULDN'T HELP BUT THINK ABOUT THE INDIVIDUALS AND THE STORIES REPRESENTED IN THE IMAGES
tst2013.talkid1532_075 ONE IN PARTICULAR A PHOTO OF WOMEN OF ALL AGES FROM GRANDMOTHER TO LITTLE GIRL GATHERED AROUND A BABY STRUCK A CHORD BECAUSE A SIMILAR PHOTO FROM MY FAMILY MY GRANDMOTHER MOTHER MYSELF AND NEWBORN DAUGHTER HANGS ON OUR WALL
tst2013.talkid1532_076 ACROSS THE GLOBE THROUGHOUT THE AGES OUR BASIC NEEDS ARE JUST THE SAME AREN'T THEY
tst2013.talkid1532_077 THANK YOU
tst2013.talkid1534_000 SO WELL I DO APPLIED MATH AND THIS IS A PECULIAR PROBLEM FOR ANYONE WHO DOES APPLIED MATH IS THAT WE ARE LIKE MANAGEMENT CONSULTANTS
tst2013.talkid1534_001 NO ONE KNOWS WHAT THE HELL WE DO
tst2013.talkid1534_002 SO I AM GOING TO GIVE YOU SOME ATTEMPT TODAY TO TRY AND EXPLAIN TO YOU WHAT I DO
tst2013.talkid1534_003 SO DANCING IS ONE OF THE MOST HUMAN OF ACTIVITIES
tst2013.talkid1534_004 WE DELIGHT AT BALLET VIRTUOSOS AND TAP DANCERS YOU WILL SEE LATER ON
tst2013.talkid1534_005 NOW BALLET REQUIRES AN EXTRAORDINARY LEVEL OF EXPERTISE AND A HIGH LEVEL OF SKILL AND PROBABLY A LEVEL OF INITIAL SUITABILITY THAT MAY WELL HAVE A GENETIC COMPONENT TO IT
tst2013.talkid1534_006 NOW SADLY NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS SUCH AS PARKINSON'S DISEASE GRADUALLY DESTROY THIS EXTRAORDINARY ABILITY AS IT IS DOING TO MY FRIEND JAN STRIPLING WHO WAS A VIRTUOSO BALLET DANCER IN HIS TIME
tst2013.talkid1534_007 SO GREAT PROGRESS IN TREATMENT HAS BEEN MADE OVER THE YEARS
tst2013.talkid1534_008 HOWEVER THERE ARE SIX POINT THREE MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE WHO HAVE THE DISEASE AND THEY HAVE TO LIVE WITH INCURABLE WEAKNESS TREMOR RIGIDITY AND THE OTHER SYMPTOMS THAT GO ALONG WITH THE DISEASE SO WHAT WE NEED ARE OBJECTIVE TOOLS TO DETECT THE DISEASE BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE
tst2013.talkid1534_009 WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MEASURE PROGRESSION OBJECTIVELY AND ULTIMATELY THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO KNOW WHEN WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CURE IS WHEN WE HAVE AN OBJECTIVE MEASURE THAT CAN ANSWER THAT FOR SURE
tst2013.talkid1534_010 BUT FRUSTRATINGLY WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE AND OTHER MOVEMENT DISORDERS THERE ARE NO BIOMARKERS SO THERE'S NO SIMPLE BLOOD TEST THAT YOU CAN DO AND THE BEST THAT WE HAVE IS LIKE THIS TWENTY MINUTE NEUROLOGIST TEST
tst2013.talkid1534_011 YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE CLINIC TO DO IT IT'S VERY VERY COSTLY AND THAT MEANS THAT OUTSIDE THE CLINICAL TRIALS IT'S JUST NEVER DONE IT'S NEVER DONE
tst2013.talkid1534_012 BUT WHAT IF PATIENTS COULD DO THIS TEST AT HOME
tst2013.talkid1534_013 NOW THAT WOULD ACTUALLY SAVE ON A DIFFICULT TRIP TO THE CLINIC AND WHAT IF PATIENTS COULD DO THAT TEST THEMSELVES RIGHT
tst2013.talkid1534_014 NO EXPENSIVE STAFF TIME REQUIRED
tst2013.talkid1534_015 TAKES ABOUT THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS BY THE WAY IN THE NEUROLOGIST'S CLINIC TO DO IT
tst2013.talkid1534_016 SO WHAT I WANT TO PROPOSE TO YOU AS AN UNCONVENTIONAL WAY IN WHICH WE CAN TRY TO ACHIEVE THIS BECAUSE YOU SEE IN ONE SENSE AT LEAST WE ARE ALL VIRTUOSOS LIKE MY FRIEND JAN STRIPLING
tst2013.talkid1534_017 SO HERE WE HAVE A VIDEO OF THE VIBRATING VOCAL FOLDS
tst2013.talkid1534_018 NOW THIS IS HEALTHY AND THIS IS SOMEBODY MAKING SPEECH SOUNDS AND WE CAN THINK OF OURSELVES AS VOCAL BALLET DANCERS BECAUSE WE HAVE TO COORDINATE ALL OF THESE VOCAL ORGANS WHEN WE MAKE SOUNDS AND WE ALL ACTUALLY HAVE THE GENES FOR IT FOX P TWO FOR EXAMPLE
tst2013.talkid1534_019 AND LIKE BALLET IT TAKES AN EXTRAORDINARY LEVEL OF TRAINING
tst2013.talkid1534_020 I MEAN JUST THINK HOW LONG IT TAKES A CHILD TO LEARN TO SPEAK
tst2013.talkid1534_021 FROM THE SOUND WE CAN ACTUALLY TRACK THE VOCAL FOLD POSITION AS IT VIBRATES AND JUST AS THE LIMBS ARE AFFECTED IN PARKINSON'S SO TOO ARE THE VOCAL ORGANS
tst2013.talkid1534_022 SO ON THE BOTTOM TRACE YOU CAN SEE AN EXAMPLE OF IRREGULAR VOCAL FOLD TREMOR
tst2013.talkid1534_023 WE SEE ALL THE SAME SYMPTOMS
tst2013.talkid1534_024 WE SEE VOCAL TREMOR WEAKNESS AND RIGIDITY
tst2013.talkid1534_025 THE SPEECH ACTUALLY BECOMES QUIETER AND MORE BREATHY AFTER A WHILE AND THAT'S ONE OF THE EXAMPLE SYMPTOMS OF IT
tst2013.talkid1534_026 SO THESE VOCAL EFFECTS CAN ACTUALLY BE QUITE SUBTLE IN SOME CASES BUT WITH ANY DIGITAL MICROPHONE AND USING PRECISION VOICE ANALYSIS SOFTWARE IN COMBINATION WITH THE LATEST IN MACHINE LEARNING WHICH IS VERY ADVANCED BY NOW WE CAN NOW QUANTIFY EXACTLY WHERE SOMEBODY LIES ON A CONTINUUM BETWEEN HEALTH AND DISEASE USING VOICE SIGNALS ALONE
tst2013.talkid1534_027 SO THESE VOICE BASED TESTS HOW DO THEY STACK UP AGAINST EXPERT CLINICAL TESTS WELL THEY'RE BOTH NON INVASIVE
tst2013.talkid1534_028 THE NEUROLOGIST'S TEST IS NON INVASIVE THEY BOTH USE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE
tst2013.talkid1534_029 YOU DON'T HAVE TO DESIGN A WHOLE NEW SET OF HOSPITALS TO DO IT
tst2013.talkid1534_030 AND THEY'RE BOTH ACCURATE OKAY BUT IN ADDITION VOICE BASED TESTS ARE NON EXPERT
tst2013.talkid1534_031 THAT MEANS THEY CAN BE SELF ADMINISTERED
tst2013.talkid1534_032 THEY'RE HIGH SPEED TAKE ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS AT MOST
tst2013.talkid1534_033 THEY'RE ULTRA LOW COST AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
tst2013.talkid1534_034 WHEN SOMETHING BECOMES ULTRA LOW COST IT BECOMES MASSIVELY SCALABLE
tst2013.talkid1534_035 AND SO HERE ARE SOME AMAZING GOALS THAT I THINK WE CAN DEAL WITH NOW
tst2013.talkid1534_036 WE CAN REDUCE LOGISTICAL DIFFICULTIES WITH PATIENTS
tst2013.talkid1534_037 NO NEED TO GO TO THE CLINIC FOR A ROUTINE CHECKUP
tst2013.talkid1534_038 WE CAN DO HIGH FREQUENCY MONITORING TO GET OBJECTIVE DATA
tst2013.talkid1534_039 WE CAN PERFORM LOW COST MASS RECRUITMENT FOR CLINICAL TRIALS AND WE CAN MAKE POPULATION SCALE SCREENING FEASIBLE FOR THE FIRST TIME
tst2013.talkid1534_040 WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO START TO SEARCH FOR THE EARLY BIOMARKERS OF THE DISEASE BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE
tst2013.talkid1534_041 SO TAKING THE FIRST STEPS TOWARDS THIS TODAY WE'RE LAUNCHING THE PARKINSON'S VOICE INITIATIVE
tst2013.talkid1534_042 WITH ACULAB AND PATIENTS LIKE ME WE'RE AIMING TO RECORD A VERY LARGE NUMBER OF VOICES WORLDWIDE TO COLLECT ENOUGH DATA TO START TO TACKLE THESE FOUR GOALS
tst2013.talkid1534_043 WE HAVE LOCAL NUMBERS ACCESSIBLE TO THREE QUARTERS OF A BILLION PEOPLE ON THE PLANET
tst2013.talkid1534_044 ANYONE HEALTHY OR WITH PARKINSON'S CAN CALL IN CHEAPLY AND LEAVE RECORDINGS A FEW CENTS EACH AND I'M REALLY HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE'VE ALREADY HIT SIX PERCENT OF OUR TARGET JUST IN EIGHT HOURS
tst2013.talkid1534_045 THANK YOU
tst2013.talkid1534_046 SO MAX BY TAKING ALL THESE SAMPLES OF LET'S SAY TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TELL WHO'S HEALTHY AND WHO'S NOT
tst2013.talkid1534_047 WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO GET OUT OF THOSE SAMPLES
tst2013.talkid1534_048 YEAH YEAH SO WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS THAT DURING THE CALL YOU HAVE TO INDICATE WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE THE DISEASE OR NOT YOU SEE RIGHT
tst2013.talkid1534_049 YOU SEE SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT DO IT THEY MAY NOT GET THROUGH IT
tst2013.talkid1534_050 BUT WE'LL GET A VERY LARGE SAMPLE OF DATA THAT IS COLLECTED FROM ALL DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND IT'S GETTING IT IN DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MATTER BECAUSE THEN WE ARE LOOKING AT IRONING OUT THE CONFOUNDING FACTORS AND LOOKING FOR THE ACTUAL MARKERS OF THE DISEASE
tst2013.talkid1534_051 SO YOU'RE EIGHTY SIX PERCENT ACCURATE RIGHT NOW
tst2013.talkid1534_052 IT'S MUCH BETTER THAN THAT
tst2013.talkid1534_053 ACTUALLY MY STUDENT THANASIS I HAVE TO PLUG HIM BECAUSE HE'S DONE SOME FANTASTIC WORK AND NOW HE HAS PROVED THAT IT WORKS OVER THE MOBILE TELEPHONE NETWORK AS WELL WHICH ENABLES THIS PROJECT AND WE'RE GETTING NINETY NINE PERCENT ACCURACY
tst2013.talkid1534_054 NINETY NINE WELL THAT'S AN IMPROVEMENT
tst2013.talkid1534_055 SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO CALL IN FROM THEIR MOBILE PHONES AND DO THIS TEST AND PEOPLE WITH PARKINSON'S COULD CALL IN RECORD THEIR VOICE AND THEN THEIR DOCTOR CAN CHECK UP ON THEIR PROGRESS SEE WHERE THEY'RE DOING IN THIS COURSE OF THE DISEASE
tst2013.talkid1534_056 ABSOLUTELY
tst2013.talkid1534_057 THANKS SO MUCH MAX LITTLE EVERYBODY
tst2013.talkid1534_058 THANKS TOM
tst2013.talkid1539_000 SO I ARRIVED BY TRUCK WITH ABOUT FIFTY REBELS TO THE BATTLE FOR JALALABAD AS A NINETEEN YEAR OLD VEGETARIAN SURFER FROM JACKSONVILLE FLORIDA
tst2013.talkid1539_001 I TRADED MY CONVERSE BLACK LOW TOPS FOR A PAIR OF BROWN LEATHER SANDALS AND LAUNCHED A ROCKET TOWARDS GOVERNMENT TANKS THAT I COULDN'T EVEN SEE
tst2013.talkid1539_002 AND THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME IN AFGHANISTAN
tst2013.talkid1539_003 LONG BEFORE THAT I HAD GROWN UP WITH THE WAR BUT ALONGSIDE WEEKEND SLEEPOVERS AND SATURDAY SOCCER GAMES AND FISTFIGHTS WITH RACIST CHILDREN OF THE CONFEDERACY AND RELIGIO NATIONALIST DEMONSTRATIONS CHANTING DOWN WITH COMMUNISM AND LONG LIVE AFGHANISTAN AND BURNING EFFIGIES OF BREZHNEV BEFORE I EVEN KNEW WHAT IT MEANT
tst2013.talkid1539_004 BUT THIS IS THE GEOGRAPHY OF SELF
tst2013.talkid1539_005 AND SO I STAND HERE TODAY AFGHAN BY BLOOD REDNECK BY THE GRACE OF GOD AN ATHEIST AND A RADICALLY POLITICIZED ARTIST WHO'S BEEN LIVING WORKING AND CREATING IN AFGHANISTAN FOR THE LAST NINE YEARS
tst2013.talkid1539_006 NOW THERE ARE A LOT OF WONDERFUL THINGS THAT YOU COULD MAKE ART ABOUT IN AFGHANISTAN BUT PERSONALLY I DON'T WANT TO PAINT RAINBOWS I WANT TO MAKE ART THAT DISTURBS IDENTITY AND CHALLENGES AUTHORITY AND EXPOSES HYPOCRISY AND REINTERPRETS REALITY AND EVEN USES KIND OF AN IMAGINATIVE ETHNOGRAPHY TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND THE WORLD THAT WE LIVE IN
tst2013.talkid1539_007 I WANT TO SPEND A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A JIHADI GANGSTER WHO WEARS HIS JIHAD AGAINST THE COMMUNISTS LIKE POPSTAR BLING AND USES ARMED RELIGIOUS INTIMIDATION AND POLITICAL CORRUPTION TO MAKE HIMSELF RICH
tst2013.talkid1539_008 AND WHERE ELSE CAN THE JIHADI GANGSTER GO BUT RUN FOR PARLIAMENT AND DO A PUBLIC INSTALLATION CAMPAIGN WITH THE SLOGAN VOTE FOR ME I'VE DONE JIHAD AND I'M RICH
tst2013.talkid1539_009 AND TRY AND USE THIS CAMPAIGN TO EXPOSE THESE MAFIOSOS WHO ARE MASQUERADING AS NATIONAL HEROES
tst2013.talkid1539_010 I WANT TO LOOK INTO CORRUPTION IN AFGHANISTAN THROUGH A WORK CALLED PAYBACK AND IMPERSONATE A POLICE OFFICER SET UP A FAKE CHECKPOINT ON THE STREET OF KABUL AND STOP CARS BUT INSTEAD OF ASKING THEM FOR A BRIBE OFFERING THEM MONEY AND APOLOGIZING ON BEHALF OF THE KABUL POLICE DEPARTMENT AND HOPING THAT THEY'LL ACCEPT THIS ONE HUNDRED AFGHANIS ON OUR BEHALF
tst2013.talkid1539_011 I WANT TO LOOK AT HOW IN MY OPINION THE CONFLICT IN AFGHANISTAN HAS BECOME CONFLICT CHIC
tst2013.talkid1539_012 THE WAR AND THE EXPATRIATE LIFE THAT COMES WITH IT HAVE CREATED THIS ENVIRONMENT OF STYLE AND FASHION THAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED THROUGH CREATING A FASHION LINE FOR SOLDIERS AND SUICIDE BOMBERS WHERE I TAKE LOCAL AFGHAN FOX FUR AND ADD IT TO A FLACK JACKET OR MAKE MULTIPLE INTERIOR POCKETS ON FASHIONABLE NEO TRADITIONAL VESTS
tst2013.talkid1539_013 AND I'D LIKE TO LOOK AT HOW TAKING A SIMPLE KABUL WHEELBARROW AND PUTTING IT ON THE WALL AMIDST KIPLING'S CALL OF EIGHTEEN NINETY NINE TO GENERATE DIALOGUE ABOUT HOW I SEE CONTEMPORARY DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES BEING ROOTED IN YESTERDAY'S COLONIAL RHETORIC ABOUT A WHITE MAN'S BURDEN TO SAVE THE BROWN MAN FROM HIMSELF AND MAYBE EVEN CIVILIZE HIM A BIT
tst2013.talkid1539_014 BUT DOING THESE THINGS THEY CAN GET YOU IN JAIL THEY CAN BE MISUNDERSTOOD MISINTERPRETED
tst2013.talkid1539_015 BUT I DO THEM BECAUSE I HAVE TO BECAUSE THE GEOGRAPHY OF SELF MANDATES IT
tst2013.talkid1539_016 THAT IS MY BURDEN WHAT'S YOURS
tst2013.talkid1539_017 THANK YOU
tst2013.talkid1541_000 I'M A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEET DOWN AN ILLEGAL MINE SHAFT IN GHANA
tst2013.talkid1541_001 THE AIR IS THICK WITH HEAT AND DUST AND IT'S HARD TO BREATHE
tst2013.talkid1541_002 I CAN FEEL THE BRUSH OF SWEATY BODIES PASSING ME IN THE DARKNESS BUT I CAN'T SEE MUCH ELSE
tst2013.talkid1541_003 I HEAR VOICES TALKING BUT MOSTLY THE SHAFT IS THIS CACOPHONY OF MEN COUGHING AND STONE BEING BROKEN WITH PRIMITIVE TOOLS
tst2013.talkid1541_004 LIKE THE OTHERS I WEAR A FLICKERING CHEAP FLASHLIGHT TIED TO MY HEAD WITH THIS ELASTIC TATTERED BAND AND I CAN BARELY MAKE OUT THE SLICK TREE LIMBS HOLDING UP THE WALLS OF THE THREE FOOT SQUARE HOLE DROPPING HUNDREDS OF FEET INTO THE EARTH
tst2013.talkid1541_005 WHEN MY HAND SLIPS I SUDDENLY REMEMBER A MINER I HAD MET DAYS BEFORE WHO HAD LOST HIS GRIP AND FELL COUNTLESS FEET DOWN THAT SHAFT
tst2013.talkid1541_006 AS I STAND TALKING TO YOU TODAY THESE MEN ARE STILL DEEP IN THAT HOLE RISKING THEIR LIVES WITHOUT PAYMENT OR COMPENSATION AND OFTEN DYING
tst2013.talkid1541_007 I GOT TO CLIMB OUT OF THAT HOLE AND I GOT TO GO HOME BUT THEY LIKELY NEVER WILL BECAUSE THEY'RE TRAPPED IN SLAVERY
tst2013.talkid1541_008 FOR THE LAST TWENTY EIGHT YEARS I'VE BEEN DOCUMENTING INDIGENOUS CULTURES IN MORE THAN SEVENTY COUNTRIES ON SIX CONTINENTS AND IN TWO THOUSAND NINE I HAD THE GREAT HONOR OF BEING THE SOLE EXHIBITOR AT THE VANCOUVER PEACE SUMMIT
tst2013.talkid1541_009 AMONGST ALL THE ASTONISHING PEOPLE I MET THERE I MET A SUPPORTER OF FREE THE SLAVES AN NGO DEDICATED TO ERADICATING MODERN DAY SLAVERY
tst2013.talkid1541_010 WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT SLAVERY AND REALLY I STARTED LEARNING ABOUT SLAVERY FOR I HAD CERTAINLY KNOWN IT EXISTED IN THE WORLD BUT NOT TO SUCH A DEGREE
tst2013.talkid1541_011 AFTER WE FINISHED TALKING I FELT SO HORRIBLE AND HONESTLY ASHAMED AT MY OWN LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF THIS ATROCITY IN MY OWN LIFETIME AND I THOUGHT IF I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
tst2013.talkid1541_012 IT STARTED BURNING A HOLE IN MY STOMACH SO WITHIN WEEKS I FLEW DOWN TO LOS ANGELES TO MEET WITH THE DIRECTOR OF FREE THE SLAVES AND OFFER THEM MY HELP
tst2013.talkid1541_013 THUS BEGAN MY JOURNEY INTO MODERN DAY SLAVERY
tst2013.talkid1541_014 ODDLY I HAD BEEN TO MANY OF THESE PLACES BEFORE
tst2013.talkid1541_015 SOME I EVEN CONSIDERED LIKE MY SECOND HOME
tst2013.talkid1541_016 BUT THIS TIME I WOULD SEE THE SKELETONS HIDDEN IN THE CLOSET
tst2013.talkid1541_017 A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE TELLS US THERE ARE MORE THAN TWENTY SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE ENSLAVED IN THE WORLD TODAY
tst2013.talkid1541_018 THAT'S DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE TAKEN FROM AFRICA DURING THE ENTIRE TRANS ATLANTIC SLAVE TRADE
tst2013.talkid1541_019 A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO AN AGRICULTURAL SLAVE COST ABOUT THREE TIMES THE ANNUAL SALARY OF AN AMERICAN WORKER
tst2013.talkid1541_020 THAT EQUATES TO ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN TODAY'S MONEY
tst2013.talkid1541_021 YET TODAY ENTIRE FAMILIES CAN BE ENSLAVED FOR GENERATIONS OVER A DEBT AS SMALL AS EIGHTEEN DOLLARS
tst2013.talkid1541_022 ASTONISHINGLY SLAVERY GENERATES PROFITS OF MORE THAN THIRTEEN BILLION DOLLARS WORLDWIDE EACH YEAR
tst2013.talkid1541_023 MANY HAVE BEEN TRICKED BY FALSE PROMISES OF A GOOD EDUCATION A BETTER JOB ONLY TO FIND THAT THEY'RE FORCED TO WORK WITHOUT PAY UNDER THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE AND THEY CANNOT WALK AWAY
tst2013.talkid1541_024 TODAY'S SLAVERY IS ABOUT COMMERCE SO THE GOODS THAT ENSLAVED PEOPLE PRODUCE HAVE VALUE BUT THE PEOPLE PRODUCING THEM ARE DISPOSABLE
tst2013.talkid1541_025 SLAVERY EXISTS EVERYWHERE NEARLY IN THE WORLD AND YET IT IS ILLEGAL EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD
tst2013.talkid1541_026 IN INDIA AND NEPAL I WAS INTRODUCED TO THE BRICK KILNS
tst2013.talkid1541_027 THIS STRANGE AND AWESOME SIGHT WAS LIKE WALKING INTO ANCIENT EGYPT OR DANTE'S INFERNO
tst2013.talkid1541_028 ENVELOPED IN TEMPERATURES OF ONE HUNDRED THIRTY DEGREES MEN WOMEN CHILDREN ENTIRE FAMILIES IN FACT WERE CLOAKED IN A HEAVY BLANKET OF DUST WHILE MECHANICALLY STACKING BRICKS ON THEIR HEAD UP TO EIGHTEEN AT A TIME AND CARRYING THEM FROM THE SCORCHING KILNS TO TRUCKS HUNDREDS OF YARDS AWAY
tst2013.talkid1541_029 DEADENED BY MONOTONY AND EXHAUSTION THEY WORK SILENTLY DOING THIS TASK OVER AND OVER FOR SIXTEEN OR SEVENTEEN HOURS A DAY
tst2013.talkid1541_030 THERE WERE NO BREAKS FOR FOOD NO WATER BREAKS AND THE SEVERE DEHYDRATION MADE URINATING PRETTY MUCH INCONSEQUENTIAL
tst2013.talkid1541_031 SO PERVASIVE WAS THE HEAT AND THE DUST THAT MY CAMERA BECAME TOO HOT TO EVEN TOUCH AND CEASED WORKING
tst2013.talkid1541_032 EVERY TWENTY MINUTES I'D HAVE TO RUN BACK TO OUR CRUISER TO CLEAN OUT MY GEAR AND RUN IT UNDER AN AIR CONDITIONER TO REVIVE IT AND AS I SAT THERE I THOUGHT MY CAMERA IS GETTING FAR BETTER TREATMENT THAN THESE PEOPLE
tst2013.talkid1541_033 BACK IN THE KILNS I WANTED TO CRY BUT THE ABOLITIONIST NEXT TO ME QUICKLY GRABBED ME AND HE SAID LISA DON'T DO THAT JUST DON'T DO THAT HERE
tst2013.talkid1541_034 AND HE VERY CLEARLY EXPLAINED TO ME THAT EMOTIONAL DISPLAYS ARE VERY DANGEROUS IN A PLACE LIKE THIS NOT JUST FOR ME BUT FOR THEM
tst2013.talkid1541_035 I COULDN'T OFFER THEM ANY DIRECT HELP
tst2013.talkid1541_036 I COULDN'T GIVE THEM MONEY NOTHING
tst2013.talkid1541_037 I WASN'T A CITIZEN OF THAT COUNTRY
tst2013.talkid1541_038 I COULD GET THEM IN A WORSE SITUATION THAN THEY WERE ALREADY IN
tst2013.talkid1541_039 I'D HAVE TO RELY ON FREE THE SLAVES TO WORK WITHIN THE SYSTEM FOR THEIR LIBERATION AND I TRUSTED THAT THEY WOULD
tst2013.talkid1541_040 AS FOR ME I'D HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL I GOT HOME TO REALLY FEEL MY HEARTBREAK
tst2013.talkid1541_041 IN THE HIMALAYAS I FOUND CHILDREN CARRYING STONE FOR MILES DOWN MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN TO TRUCKS WAITING AT ROADS BELOW
tst2013.talkid1541_042 THE BIG SHEETS OF SLATE WERE HEAVIER THAN THE CHILDREN CARRYING THEM AND THE KIDS HOISTED THEM FROM THEIR HEADS USING THESE HANDMADE HARNESSES OF STICKS AND ROPE AND TORN CLOTH
tst2013.talkid1541_043 IT'S DIFFICULT TO WITNESS SOMETHING SO OVERWHELMING
tst2013.talkid1541_044 HOW CAN WE AFFECT SOMETHING SO INSIDIOUS YET SO PERVASIVE
tst2013.talkid1541_045 SOME DON'T EVEN KNOW THEY'RE ENSLAVED PEOPLE WORKING SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN HOURS A DAY WITHOUT ANY PAY BECAUSE THIS HAS BEEN THE CASE ALL THEIR LIVES
tst2013.talkid1541_046 THEY HAVE NOTHING TO COMPARE IT TO
tst2013.talkid1541_047 WHEN THESE VILLAGERS CLAIMED THEIR FREEDOM THE SLAVEHOLDERS BURNED DOWN ALL OF THEIR HOUSES
tst2013.talkid1541_048 I MEAN THESE PEOPLE HAD NOTHING AND THEY WERE SO PETRIFIED THEY WANTED TO GIVE UP BUT THE WOMAN IN THE CENTER RALLIED FOR THEM TO PERSEVERE AND ABOLITIONISTS ON THE GROUND HELPED THEM GET A QUARRY LEASE OF THEIR OWN SO THAT NOW THEY DO THE SAME BACK BREAKING WORK BUT THEY DO IT FOR THEMSELVES AND THEY GET PAID FOR IT AND THEY DO IT IN FREEDOM
tst2013.talkid1541_049 SEX TRAFFICKING IS WHAT WE OFTEN THINK OF WHEN WE HEAR THE WORD SLAVERY AND BECAUSE OF THIS WORLDWIDE AWARENESS I WAS WARNED THAT IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR ME TO WORK SAFELY WITHIN THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY
tst2013.talkid1541_050 IN KATHMANDU I WAS ESCORTED BY WOMEN WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN SEX SLAVES THEMSELVES
tst2013.talkid1541_051 THEY USHERED ME DOWN A NARROW SET OF STAIRS THAT LED TO THIS DIRTY DIMLY FLUORESCENT LIT BASEMENT
tst2013.talkid1541_052 THIS WASN'T A BROTHEL PER SE
tst2013.talkid1541_053 IT WAS MORE LIKE A RESTAURANT
tst2013.talkid1541_054 CABIN RESTAURANTS AS THEY'RE KNOWN IN THE TRADE ARE VENUES FOR FORCED PROSTITUTION
tst2013.talkid1541_055 EACH HAS SMALL PRIVATE ROOMS WHERE THE SLAVES WOMEN ALONG WITH YOUNG GIRLS AND BOYS SOME AS YOUNG AS SEVEN YEARS OLD ARE FORCED TO ENTERTAIN THE CLIENTS ENCOURAGING THEM TO BUY MORE FOOD AND ALCOHOL
tst2013.talkid1541_056 EACH CUBICLE IS DARK AND DINGY IDENTIFIED WITH A PAINTED NUMBER ON THE WALL AND PARTITIONED BY PLYWOOD AND A CURTAIN
tst2013.talkid1541_057 THE WORKERS HERE OFTEN ENDURE TRAGIC SEXUAL ABUSE AT THE HANDS OF THEIR CUSTOMERS
tst2013.talkid1541_058 STANDING IN THE NEAR DARKNESS I REMEMBER FEELING THIS QUICK HOT FEAR AND IN THAT INSTANT I COULD ONLY IMAGINE WHAT IT MUST BE LIKE TO BE TRAPPED IN THAT HELL
tst2013.talkid1541_059 I HAD ONLY ONE WAY OUT THE STAIRS FROM WHERE I'D COME IN
tst2013.talkid1541_060 THERE WERE NO BACK DOORS
tst2013.talkid1541_061 THERE WERE NO WINDOWS LARGE ENOUGH TO CLIMB THROUGH
tst2013.talkid1541_062 THESE PEOPLE HAVE NO ESCAPE AT ALL AND AS WE TAKE IN SUCH A DIFFICULT SUBJECT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT SLAVERY INCLUDING SEX TRAFFICKING OCCURS IN OUR OWN BACKYARD AS WELL
tst2013.talkid1541_063 TENS OF HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ARE ENSLAVED IN AGRICULTURE IN RESTAURANTS IN DOMESTIC SERVITUDE AND THE LIST CAN GO ON
tst2013.talkid1541_064 RECENTLY THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTED THAT BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND AMERICAN CHILDREN ARE SOLD INTO SEX SLAVERY EVERY YEAR
tst2013.talkid1541_065 IT'S ALL AROUND US WE JUST DON'T SEE IT
tst2013.talkid1541_066 THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY IS ANOTHER ONE WE OFTEN THINK OF WHEN WE HEAR ABOUT SLAVE LABOR
tst2013.talkid1541_067 I VISITED VILLAGES IN INDIA WHERE ENTIRE FAMILIES WERE ENSLAVED IN THE SILK TRADE
tst2013.talkid1541_068 THIS IS A FAMILY PORTRAIT
tst2013.talkid1541_069 THE DYED BLACK HANDS ARE THE FATHER WHILE THE BLUE AND RED HANDS ARE HIS SONS
tst2013.talkid1541_070 THEY MIX DYE IN THESE BIG BARRELS AND THEY SUBMERGE THE SILK INTO THE LIQUID UP TO THEIR ELBOWS BUT THE DYE IS TOXIC
tst2013.talkid1541_071 MY INTERPRETER TOLD ME THEIR STORIES
tst2013.talkid1541_072 WE HAVE NO FREEDOM THEY SAID
tst2013.talkid1541_073 WE HOPE STILL THOUGH THAT WE COULD LEAVE THIS HOUSE SOMEDAY AND GO SOMEPLACE ELSE WHERE WE ACTUALLY GET PAID FOR OUR DYEING
tst2013.talkid1541_074 IT'S ESTIMATED THAT MORE THAN FOUR THOUSAND CHILDREN ARE ENSLAVED ON LAKE VOLTA THE LARGEST MAN MADE LAKE IN THE WORLD
tst2013.talkid1541_075 WHEN WE FIRST ARRIVED I WENT TO HAVE A QUICK LOOK
tst2013.talkid1541_076 I SAW WHAT SEEMED TO BE A FAMILY FISHING ON A BOAT TWO OLDER BROTHERS SOME YOUNGER KIDS MAKES SENSE RIGHT
tst2013.talkid1541_077 WRONG THEY WERE ALL ENSLAVED
tst2013.talkid1541_078 CHILDREN ARE TAKEN FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND TRAFFICKED AND VANISHED AND THEY'RE FORCED TO WORK ENDLESS HOURS ON THESE BOATS ON THE LAKE EVEN THOUGH THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO SWIM
tst2013.talkid1541_079 THIS YOUNG CHILD IS EIGHT YEARS OLD
tst2013.talkid1541_080 HE WAS TREMBLING WHEN OUR BOAT APPROACHED FRIGHTENED IT WOULD RUN OVER HIS TINY CANOE
tst2013.talkid1541_081 HE WAS PETRIFIED HE WOULD BE KNOCKED IN THE WATER
tst2013.talkid1541_082 THE SKELETAL TREE LIMBS SUBMERGED IN LAKE VOLTA OFTEN CATCH THE FISHING NETS AND WEARY FRIGHTENED CHILDREN ARE THROWN INTO THE WATER TO UNTETHER THE LINES
tst2013.talkid1541_083 MANY OF THEM DROWN
tst2013.talkid1541_084 FOR AS LONG AS HE CAN RECALL HE'S BEEN FORCED TO WORK ON THE LAKE
tst2013.talkid1541_085 TERRIFIED OF HIS MASTER HE WILL NOT RUN AWAY AND SINCE HE'S BEEN TREATED WITH CRUELTY ALL HIS LIFE HE PASSES THAT DOWN TO THE YOUNGER SLAVES THAT HE MANAGES
tst2013.talkid1541_086 I MET THESE BOYS AT FIVE IN THE MORNING WHEN THEY WERE HAULING IN THE LAST OF THEIR NETS BUT THEY HAD BEEN WORKING SINCE ONE AM
tst2013.talkid1541_087 IN THE COLD WINDY NIGHT
tst2013.talkid1541_088 AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THESE NETS WEIGH MORE THAN A THOUSAND POUNDS WHEN THEY'RE FULL OF FISH
tst2013.talkid1541_089 I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO KOFI
tst2013.talkid1541_090 KOFI WAS RESCUED FROM A FISHING VILLAGE
tst2013.talkid1541_091 I MET HIM AT A SHELTER WHERE FREE THE SLAVES REHABILITATES VICTIMS OF SLAVERY
tst2013.talkid1541_092 HERE HE'S SEEN TAKING A BATH AT THE WELL POURING BIG BUCKETS OF WATER OVER HIS HEAD AND THE WONDERFUL NEWS IS AS YOU AND I ARE SITTING HERE TALKING TODAY KOFI HAS BEEN REUNITED WITH HIS FAMILY AND WHAT'S EVEN BETTER HIS FAMILY HAS BEEN GIVEN TOOLS TO MAKE A LIVING AND TO KEEP THEIR CHILDREN SAFE
tst2013.talkid1541_093 KOFI IS THE EMBODIMENT OF POSSIBILITY
tst2013.talkid1541_094 WHO WILL HE BECOME BECAUSE SOMEONE TOOK A STAND AND MADE A DIFFERENCE IN HIS LIFE
tst2013.talkid1541_095 DRIVING DOWN A ROAD IN GHANA WITH PARTNERS OF FREE THE SLAVES A FELLOW ABOLITIONIST ON A MOPED SUDDENLY SPED UP TO OUR CRUISER AND TAPPED ON THE WINDOW
tst2013.talkid1541_096 HE TOLD US TO FOLLOW HIM DOWN A DIRT ROAD INTO THE JUNGLE
tst2013.talkid1541_097 AT THE END OF THE ROAD HE URGED US OUT OF THE CAR AND TOLD THE DRIVER TO QUICKLY LEAVE
tst2013.talkid1541_098 THEN HE POINTED TOWARD THIS BARELY VISIBLE FOOTPATH AND SAID THIS IS THE PATH THIS IS THE PATH GO
tst2013.talkid1541_099 AS WE STARTED DOWN THE PATH WE PUSHED ASIDE THE VINES BLOCKING THE WAY AND AFTER ABOUT AN HOUR OF WALKING IN FOUND THAT THE TRAIL HAD BECOME FLOODED BY RECENT RAINS SO I HOISTED THE PHOTO GEAR ABOVE MY HEAD AS WE DESCENDED INTO THESE WATERS UP TO MY CHEST
tst2013.talkid1541_100 AFTER ANOTHER TWO HOURS OF HIKING THE WINDING TRAIL ABRUPTLY ENDED AT A CLEARING AND BEFORE US WAS A MASS OF HOLES THAT COULD FIT INTO THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALL FIELD AND ALL OF THEM WERE FULL OF ENSLAVED PEOPLE LABORING
tst2013.talkid1541_101 MANY WOMEN HAD CHILDREN STRAPPED TO THEIR BACKS WHILE THEY WERE PANNING FOR GOLD WADING IN WATER POISONED BY MERCURY
tst2013.talkid1541_102 MERCURY IS USED IN THE EXTRACTION PROCESS
tst2013.talkid1541_103 THESE MINERS ARE ENSLAVED IN A MINE SHAFT IN ANOTHER PART OF GHANA
tst2013.talkid1541_104 WHEN THEY CAME OUT OF THE SHAFT THEY WERE SOAKING WET FROM THEIR OWN SWEAT
tst2013.talkid1541_105 I REMEMBER LOOKING INTO THEIR TIRED BLOODSHOT EYES FOR MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN UNDERGROUND FOR SEVENTY TWO HOURS
tst2013.talkid1541_106 THE SHAFTS ARE UP TO THREE HUNDRED FEET DEEP AND THEY CARRY OUT HEAVY BAGS OF STONE THAT LATER WILL BE TRANSPORTED TO ANOTHER AREA WHERE THE STONE WILL BE POUNDED SO THAT THEY CAN EXTRACT THE GOLD
tst2013.talkid1541_107 AT FIRST GLANCE THE POUNDING SITE SEEMS FULL OF POWERFUL MEN BUT WHEN WE LOOK CLOSER WE SEE SOME LESS FORTUNATE WORKING ON THE FRINGES AND CHILDREN TOO
tst2013.talkid1541_108 ALL OF THEM ARE VICTIM TO INJURY ILLNESS AND VIOLENCE
tst2013.talkid1541_109 IN FACT IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT THIS MUSCULAR PERSON WILL END UP LIKE THIS ONE HERE RACKED WITH TUBERCULOSIS AND MERCURY POISONING IN JUST A FEW YEARS
tst2013.talkid1541_110 THIS IS MANURU WHEN HIS FATHER DIED HIS UNCLE TRAFFICKED HIM TO WORK WITH HIM IN THE MINES
tst2013.talkid1541_111 WHEN HIS UNCLE DIED MANURU INHERITED HIS UNCLE'S DEBT WHICH FURTHER FORCED HIM INTO BEING ENSLAVED IN THE MINES
tst2013.talkid1541_112 WHEN I MET HIM HE HAD BEEN WORKING IN THE MINES FOR FOURTEEN YEARS AND THE LEG INJURY THAT YOU SEE HERE IS ACTUALLY FROM A MINING ACCIDENT ONE SO SEVERE DOCTORS SAY HIS LEG SHOULD BE AMPUTATED
tst2013.talkid1541_113 ON TOP OF THAT MANURU HAS TUBERCULOSIS YET HE'S STILL FORCED TO WORK DAY IN AND DAY OUT IN THAT MINE SHAFT
tst2013.talkid1541_114 EVEN STILL HE HAS A DREAM THAT HE WILL BECOME FREE AND BECOME EDUCATED WITH THE HELP OF LOCAL ACTIVISTS LIKE FREE THE SLAVES AND IT'S THIS SORT OF DETERMINATION IN THE FACE OF UNIMAGINABLE ODDS THAT FILLS ME WITH COMPLETE AWE
tst2013.talkid1541_115 I WANT TO SHINE A LIGHT ON SLAVERY
tst2013.talkid1541_116 WHEN I WAS WORKING IN THE FIELD I BROUGHT LOTS OF CANDLES WITH ME AND WITH THE HELP OF MY INTERPRETER I IMPARTED TO THE PEOPLE I WAS PHOTOGRAPHING THAT I WANTED TO ILLUMINATE THEIR STORIES AND THEIR PLIGHT SO WHEN IT WAS SAFE FOR THEM AND SAFE FOR ME I MADE THESE IMAGES
tst2013.talkid1541_117 THEY KNEW THEIR IMAGE WOULD BE SEEN BY YOU OUT IN THE WORLD
tst2013.talkid1541_118 I WANTED THEM TO KNOW THAT WE WILL BE BEARING WITNESS TO THEM AND THAT WE WILL DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO HELP MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THEIR LIVES
tst2013.talkid1541_119 I TRULY BELIEVE IF WE CAN SEE ONE ANOTHER AS FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS THEN IT BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT TO TOLERATE ATROCITIES LIKE SLAVERY
tst2013.talkid1541_120 THESE IMAGES ARE NOT OF ISSUES THEY ARE OF PEOPLE REAL PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME ALL DESERVING OF THE SAME RIGHTS DIGNITY AND RESPECT IN THEIR LIVES
tst2013.talkid1541_121 THERE IS NOT A DAY THAT GOES BY THAT I DON'T THINK OF THESE MANY BEAUTIFUL MISTREATED PEOPLE I'VE HAD THE TREMENDOUS HONOR OF MEETING
tst2013.talkid1541_122 I HOPE THAT THESE IMAGES AWAKEN A FORCE IN THOSE WHO VIEW THEM PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND I HOPE THAT FORCE WILL IGNITE A FIRE AND THAT FIRE WILL SHINE A LIGHT ON SLAVERY FOR WITHOUT THAT LIGHT THE BEAST OF BONDAGE CAN CONTINUE TO LIVE IN THE SHADOWS
tst2013.talkid1541_123 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
tst2013.talkid1548_000 ONE OF MY FAVORITE WORDS IN THE WHOLE OF THE OXFORD ENGLISH DICTIONARY IS SNOLLYGOSTER
tst2013.talkid1548_001 JUST BECAUSE IT SOUNDS SO GOOD
tst2013.talkid1548_002 AND WHAT SNOLLYGOSTER MEANS IS A DISHONEST POLITICIAN
tst2013.talkid1548_003 ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A NINETEENTH CENTURY NEWSPAPER EDITOR WHO DEFINED IT RATHER BETTER WHEN HE SAID A SNOLLYGOSTER IS A FELLOW WHO SEEKS OFFICE REGARDLESS OF PARTY PLATFORM OR PRINCIPLE AND WHO WHEN HE WINS GETS THERE BY THE SHEER FORCE OF MONUMENTAL TALKNOPHICAL ASSUMNANCY
tst2013.talkid1548_004 NOW I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TALKNOPHICAL IS
tst2013.talkid1548_005 SOMETHING TO DO WITH WORDS I ASSUME
tst2013.talkid1548_006 BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WORDS ARE AT THE CENTER OF POLITICS AND ALL POLITICIANS KNOW THEY HAVE TO TRY AND CONTROL LANGUAGE
tst2013.talkid1548_007 IT WASN'T UNTIL FOR EXAMPLE SEVENTEEN SEVENTY ONE THAT THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT ALLOWED NEWSPAPERS TO REPORT THE EXACT WORDS THAT WERE SAID IN THE DEBATING CHAMBER
tst2013.talkid1548_008 AND THIS WAS ACTUALLY ALL DOWN TO THE BRAVERY OF A GUY WITH THE EXTRAORDINARY NAME OF BRASS CROSBY WHO TOOK ON PARLIAMENT
tst2013.talkid1548_009 AND HE WAS THROWN INTO THE TOWER OF LONDON AND IMPRISONED AND BUT HE WAS BRAVE ENOUGH HE WAS BRAVE ENOUGH TO TAKE THEM ON AND IN THE END HE HAD SUCH POPULAR SUPPORT IN LONDON THAT HE WON
tst2013.talkid1548_010 AND IT WAS ONLY A FEW YEARS LATER THAT WE HAVE THE FIRST RECORDED USE OF THE PHRASE AS BOLD AS BRASS
tst2013.talkid1548_011 MOST PEOPLE THINK THAT'S DOWN TO THE METAL
tst2013.talkid1548_012 IT'S NOT IT'S DOWN TO A CAMPAIGNER FOR THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS
tst2013.talkid1548_013 BUT TO REALLY SHOW YOU HOW WORDS AND POLITICS INTERACT I WANT TO TAKE YOU BACK TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA JUST AFTER THEY'D ACHIEVED INDEPENDENCE
tst2013.talkid1548_014 AND THEY HAD TO FACE THE QUESTION OF WHAT TO CALL GEORGE WASHINGTON THEIR LEADER
tst2013.talkid1548_015 THEY DIDN'T KNOW
tst2013.talkid1548_016 WHAT DO YOU CALL THE LEADER OF A REPUBLICAN COUNTRY
tst2013.talkid1548_017 AND THIS WAS DEBATED IN CONGRESS FOR AGES AND AGES
tst2013.talkid1548_018 AND THERE WERE ALL SORTS OF SUGGESTIONS ON THE TABLE WHICH MIGHT HAVE MADE IT
tst2013.talkid1548_019 I MEAN SOME PEOPLE WANTED HIM TO BE CALLED CHIEF MAGISTRATE WASHINGTON AND OTHER PEOPLE HIS HIGHNESS GEORGE WASHINGTON AND OTHER PEOPLE PROTECTOR OF THE PROTECTOR OF THE LIBERTIES OF THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WASHINGTON
tst2013.talkid1548_020 NOT THAT CATCHY
tst2013.talkid1548_021 SOME PEOPLE JUST WANTED TO CALL HIM KING
tst2013.talkid1548_022 THEY THOUGHT IT WAS TRIED AND TESTED
tst2013.talkid1548_023 AND THEY WEREN'T EVEN BEING MONARCHICAL THERE THEY HAD THE IDEA THAT YOU COULD BE ELECTED KING FOR A FIXED TERM
tst2013.talkid1548_024 AND YOU KNOW IT COULD HAVE WORKED
tst2013.talkid1548_025 AND EVERYBODY GOT INSANELY BORED ACTUALLY BECAUSE THIS DEBATE WENT ON FOR THREE WEEKS
tst2013.talkid1548_026 I READ A DIARY OF THIS POOR SENATOR WHO JUST KEEPS COMING BACK STILL ON THIS SUBJECT
tst2013.talkid1548_027 AND THE REASON FOR THE DELAY AND THE BOREDOM WAS THAT THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WERE AGAINST THE SENATE
tst2013.talkid1548_028 THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES DIDN'T WANT WASHINGTON TO GET DRUNK ON POWER
tst2013.talkid1548_029 THEY DIDN'T WANT TO CALL HIM KING IN CASE THAT GAVE HIM IDEAS OR HIS SUCCESSOR IDEAS
tst2013.talkid1548_030 SO THEY WANTED TO GIVE HIM THE HUMBLEST MEAGEREST MOST PATHETIC TITLE THAT THEY COULD THINK OF
tst2013.talkid1548_031 AND THAT TITLE WAS PRESIDENT
tst2013.talkid1548_032 PRESIDENT THEY DIDN'T INVENT THE TITLE I MEAN IT EXISTED BEFORE BUT IT JUST MEANT SOMEBODY WHO PRESIDES OVER A MEETING
tst2013.talkid1548_033 IT WAS LIKE THE THE FOREMAN OF THE JURY
tst2013.talkid1548_034 AND IT DIDN'T HAVE MUCH MORE GRANDEUR THAN THE TERM FOREMAN OR OVERSEER
tst2013.talkid1548_035 THERE WERE OCCASIONAL PRESIDENTS OF LITTLE COLONIAL COUNCILS AND BITS OF GOVERNMENT BUT IT WAS REALLY A NOTHING TITLE
tst2013.talkid1548_036 AND THAT'S WHY THE SENATE OBJECTED TO IT
tst2013.talkid1548_037 THEY SAID THAT'S RIDICULOUS YOU CAN'T CALL HIM PRESIDENT
tst2013.talkid1548_038 THIS GUY HAS TO GO AND SIGN TREATIES AND MEET FOREIGN DIGNITARIES
tst2013.talkid1548_039 AND WHO'S GOING TO TAKE HIM SERIOUSLY IF HE'S GOT A SILLY LITTLE TITLE LIKE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
tst2013.talkid1548_040 AND AFTER THREE WEEKS OF DEBATE IN THE END THE SENATE DID NOT CAVE IN
tst2013.talkid1548_041 INSTEAD THEY AGREED TO USE THE TITLE PRESIDENT FOR NOW BUT THEY ALSO WANTED IT ABSOLUTELY SET DOWN THAT THEY DIDN'T AGREE WITH IT FROM A A DECENT RESPECT FOR THE OPINIONS AND PRACTICE OF CIVILIZED NATIONS WHETHER UNDER REPUBLICAN OR MONARCHICAL FORMS OF GOVERNMENT WHOSE CUSTOM IT IS TO ANNEX THROUGH THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE TITLES OF RESPECTABILITY NOT BLOODY PRESIDENT AND THAT IN THE INTERCOURSE WITH FOREIGN NATIONS THE MAJESTY OF THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES MAY NOT BE HAZARDED BY AN APPEARANCE OF SINGULARITY IE WE DON'T WANT TO LOOK LIKE BLOODY WEIRDOS
tst2013.talkid1548_042 NOW YOU CAN LEARN THREE INTERESTING THINGS FROM THIS
tst2013.talkid1548_043 FIRST OF ALL AND THIS IS MY FAVORITE IS THAT SO FAR AS I'VE EVER BEEN ABLE TO FIND OUT THE SENATE HAS NEVER FORMALLY ENDORSED THE TITLE OF PRESIDENT
tst2013.talkid1548_044 BARACK OBAMA PRESIDENT OBAMA IS THERE ON BORROWED TIME JUST WAITING FOR THE SENATE TO SPRING INTO ACTION
tst2013.talkid1548_045 SECOND THING YOU CAN LEARN IS THAT WHEN A GOVERNMENT SAYS THAT THIS IS A TEMPORARY MEASURE YOU CAN STILL BE WAITING TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE YEARS LATER
tst2013.talkid1548_046 BUT THE THIRD THING YOU CAN LEARN AND THIS IS THE REALLY IMPORTANT ONE THIS IS THE POINT I WANT TO LEAVE YOU ON IS THAT THE TITLE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA DOESN'T SOUND THAT HUMBLE AT ALL THESE DAYS DOES IT
tst2013.talkid1548_047 SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE SLIGHTLY OVER FIVE THOUSAND NUCLEAR WARHEADS HE HAS AT HIS DISPOSAL AND THE LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD AND A FLEET OF DRONES AND ALL THAT SORT OF STUFF
tst2013.talkid1548_048 REALITY AND HISTORY HAVE ENDOWED THAT TITLE WITH GRANDEUR
tst2013.talkid1548_049 AND SO THE SENATE WON IN THE END
tst2013.talkid1548_050 THEY GOT THEIR TITLE OF RESPECTABILITY
tst2013.talkid1548_051 AND ALSO THE SENATE'S OTHER WORRY THE APPEARANCE OF SINGULARITY WELL IT WAS A SINGULARITY BACK THEN
tst2013.talkid1548_052 BUT NOW DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY NATIONS HAVE A PRESIDENT
tst2013.talkid1548_053 A HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN
tst2013.talkid1548_054 ALL BECAUSE THEY WANT TO SOUND LIKE THE GUY WHO'S GOT THE FIVE THOUSAND NUCLEAR WARHEADS ETC
tst2013.talkid1548_055 AND SO IN THE END THE SENATE WON AND THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES LOST BECAUSE NOBODY'S GOING TO FEEL THAT HUMBLE WHEN THEY'RE TOLD THAT THEY ARE NOW THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
tst2013.talkid1548_056 AND THAT'S THE IMPORTANT LESSON I THINK YOU CAN TAKE AWAY AND THE ONE I WANT TO LEAVE YOU WITH
tst2013.talkid1548_057 POLITICIANS TRY TO PICK WORDS AND USE WORDS TO SHAPE REALITY AND CONTROL REALITY BUT IN FACT REALITY CHANGES WORDS FAR MORE THAN WORDS CAN EVER CHANGE REALITY
tst2013.talkid1548_058 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
tst2013.talkid1553_000 THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS THE PEOPLE AROUND US CAN HELP IMPROVE OUR LIVES
tst2013.talkid1553_001 WE DON'T BUMP INTO EVERY NEIGHBOR SO A LOT OF WISDOM NEVER GETS PASSED ON THOUGH WE DO SHARE THE SAME PUBLIC SPACES
tst2013.talkid1553_002 SO OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS I'VE TRIED WAYS TO SHARE MORE WITH MY NEIGHBORS IN PUBLIC SPACE USING SIMPLE TOOLS LIKE STICKERS STENCILS AND CHALK
tst2013.talkid1553_003 AND THESE PROJECTS CAME FROM QUESTIONS I HAD LIKE HOW MUCH ARE MY NEIGHBORS PAYING FOR THEIR APARTMENTS
tst2013.talkid1553_004 HOW CAN WE LEND AND BORROW MORE THINGS WITHOUT KNOCKING ON EACH OTHER'S DOORS AT A BAD TIME
tst2013.talkid1553_005 HOW CAN WE SHARE MORE OF OUR MEMORIES OF OUR ABANDONED BUILDINGS AND GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF OUR LANDSCAPE
tst2013.talkid1553_006 AND HOW CAN WE SHARE MORE OF OUR HOPES FOR OUR VACANT STOREFRONTS SO OUR COMMUNITIES CAN REFLECT OUR NEEDS AND DREAMS TODAY
tst2013.talkid1553_007 NOW I LIVE IN NEW ORLEANS AND I AM IN LOVE WITH NEW ORLEANS
tst2013.talkid1553_008 MY SOUL IS ALWAYS SOOTHED BY THE GIANT LIVE OAK TREES SHADING LOVERS DRUNKS AND DREAMERS FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS AND I TRUST A CITY THAT ALWAYS MAKES WAY FOR MUSIC
tst2013.talkid1553_009 I FEEL LIKE EVERY TIME SOMEONE SNEEZES NEW ORLEANS HAS A PARADE
tst2013.talkid1553_010 THE CITY HAS SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL ARCHITECTURE IN THE WORLD BUT IT ALSO HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST AMOUNTS OF ABANDONED PROPERTIES IN AMERICA
tst2013.talkid1553_011 I LIVE NEAR THIS HOUSE AND I THOUGHT ABOUT HOW I COULD MAKE IT A NICER SPACE FOR MY NEIGHBORHOOD AND I ALSO THOUGHT ABOUT SOMETHING THAT CHANGED MY LIFE FOREVER
tst2013.talkid1553_012 IN TWO THOUSAND NINE I LOST SOMEONE I LOVED VERY MUCH
tst2013.talkid1553_013 HER NAME WAS JOAN AND SHE WAS A MOTHER TO ME AND HER DEATH WAS SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED
tst2013.talkid1553_014 AND I THOUGHT ABOUT DEATH A LOT AND THIS MADE ME FEEL DEEP GRATITUDE FOR THE TIME I'VE HAD AND BROUGHT CLARITY TO THE THINGS THAT ARE MEANINGFUL TO MY LIFE NOW
tst2013.talkid1553_015 BUT I STRUGGLE TO MAINTAIN THIS PERSPECTIVE IN MY DAILY LIFE
tst2013.talkid1553_016 I FEEL LIKE IT'S EASY TO GET CAUGHT UP IN THE DAY TO DAY AND FORGET WHAT REALLY MATTERS TO YOU
tst2013.talkid1553_017 SO WITH HELP FROM OLD AND NEW FRIENDS I TURNED THE SIDE OF THIS ABANDONED HOUSE INTO A GIANT CHALKBOARD AND STENCILED IT WITH A FILL IN THE BLANK SENTENCE BEFORE I DIE I WANT TO SO ANYONE WALKING BY CAN PICK UP A PIECE OF CHALK REFLECT ON THEIR LIVES AND SHARE THEIR PERSONAL ASPIRATIONS IN PUBLIC SPACE
tst2013.talkid1553_018 I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THIS EXPERIMENT BUT BY THE NEXT DAY THE WALL WAS ENTIRELY FILLED OUT AND IT KEPT GROWING
tst2013.talkid1553_019 AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE A FEW THINGS THAT PEOPLE WROTE ON THIS WALL
tst2013.talkid1553_020 BEFORE I DIE I WANT TO BE TRIED FOR PIRACY
tst2013.talkid1553_021 BEFORE I DIE I WANT TO STRADDLE THE INTERNATIONAL DATE LINE
tst2013.talkid1553_022 BEFORE I DIE I WANT TO SING FOR MILLIONS
tst2013.talkid1553_023 BEFORE I DIE I WANT TO PLANT A TREE
tst2013.talkid1553_024 BEFORE I DIE I WANT TO LIVE OFF THE GRID
tst2013.talkid1553_025 BEFORE I DIE I WANT TO HOLD HER ONE MORE TIME
tst2013.talkid1553_026 BEFORE I DIE I WANT TO BE SOMEONE'S CAVALRY
tst2013.talkid1553_027 BEFORE I DIE I WANT TO BE COMPLETELY MYSELF
tst2013.talkid1553_028 SO THIS NEGLECTED SPACE BECAME A CONSTRUCTIVE ONE AND PEOPLE'S HOPES AND DREAMS MADE ME LAUGH OUT LOUD TEAR UP AND THEY CONSOLED ME DURING MY OWN TOUGH TIMES
tst2013.talkid1553_029 IT'S ABOUT KNOWING YOU'RE NOT ALONE
tst2013.talkid1553_030 IT'S ABOUT UNDERSTANDING OUR NEIGHBORS IN NEW AND ENLIGHTENING WAYS
tst2013.talkid1553_031 IT'S ABOUT MAKING SPACE FOR REFLECTION AND CONTEMPLATION AND REMEMBERING WHAT REALLY MATTERS MOST TO US AS WE GROW AND CHANGE
tst2013.talkid1553_032 I MADE THIS LAST YEAR AND STARTED RECEIVING HUNDREDS OF MESSAGES FROM PASSIONATE PEOPLE WHO WANTED TO MAKE A WALL WITH THEIR COMMUNITY SO MY CIVIC CENTER COLLEAGUES AND I MADE A TOOL KIT AND NOW WALLS HAVE BEEN MADE IN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING KAZAKHSTAN SOUTH AFRICA AUSTRALIA ARGENTINA AND BEYOND
tst2013.talkid1553_033 TOGETHER WE'VE SHOWN HOW POWERFUL OUR PUBLIC SPACES CAN BE IF WE'RE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A VOICE AND SHARE MORE WITH ONE ANOTHER
tst2013.talkid1553_034 TWO OF THE MOST VALUABLE THINGS WE HAVE ARE TIME AND OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER PEOPLE
tst2013.talkid1553_035 IN OUR AGE OF INCREASING DISTRACTIONS IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER TO FIND WAYS TO MAINTAIN PERSPECTIVE AND REMEMBER THAT LIFE IS BRIEF AND TENDER
tst2013.talkid1553_036 DEATH IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE OFTEN DISCOURAGED TO TALK ABOUT OR EVEN THINK ABOUT BUT I'VE REALIZED THAT PREPARING FOR DEATH IS ONE OF THE MOST EMPOWERING THINGS YOU CAN DO
tst2013.talkid1553_037 THINKING ABOUT DEATH CLARIFIES YOUR LIFE
tst2013.talkid1553_038 OUR SHARED SPACES CAN BETTER REFLECT WHAT MATTERS TO US AS INDIVIDUALS AND AS A COMMUNITY AND WITH MORE WAYS TO SHARE OUR HOPES FEARS AND STORIES THE PEOPLE AROUND US CAN NOT ONLY HELP US MAKE BETTER PLACES THEY CAN HELP US LEAD BETTER LIVES
tst2013.talkid1553_039 THANK YOU
tst2013.talkid1553_040 THANK YOU
tst2013.talkid1592_000 FIVE YEARS AGO I EXPERIENCED A BIT OF WHAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE TO BE ALICE IN WONDERLAND
tst2013.talkid1592_001 PENN STATE ASKED ME A COMMUNICATIONS TEACHER TO TEACH A COMMUNICATIONS CLASS FOR ENGINEERING STUDENTS
tst2013.talkid1592_002 AND I WAS SCARED
tst2013.talkid1592_003 REALLY SCARED SCARED OF THESE STUDENTS WITH THEIR BIG BRAINS AND THEIR BIG BOOKS AND THEIR BIG UNFAMILIAR WORDS
tst2013.talkid1592_004 BUT AS THESE CONVERSATIONS UNFOLDED I EXPERIENCED WHAT ALICE MUST HAVE WHEN SHE WENT DOWN THAT RABBIT HOLE AND SAW THAT DOOR TO A WHOLE NEW WORLD
tst2013.talkid1592_005 THAT'S JUST HOW I FELT AS I HAD THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE STUDENTS I WAS AMAZED AT THE IDEAS THAT THEY THAT THEY HAD AND I WANTED OTHERS TO EXPERIENCE THIS WONDERLAND AS WELL
tst2013.talkid1592_006 AND I BELIEVE THE KEY TO OPENING THAT DOOR IS GREAT COMMUNICATION
tst2013.talkid1592_007 WE DESPERATELY NEED GREAT COMMUNICATION FROM OUR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS IN ORDER TO CHANGE THE WORLD
tst2013.talkid1592_008 OUR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS ARE THE ONES THAT ARE TACKLING OUR GRANDEST CHALLENGES FROM ENERGY TO ENVIRONMENT TO HEALTH CARE AMONG OTHERS AND IF WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT AND UNDERSTAND IT THEN THE WORK ISN'T DONE AND I BELIEVE IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS NON SCIENTISTS TO HAVE THESE INTERACTIONS
tst2013.talkid1592_009 BUT THESE GREAT CONVERSATIONS CAN'T OCCUR IF OUR SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS DON'T INVITE US IN TO SEE THEIR WONDERLAND
tst2013.talkid1592_010 SO SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS PLEASE TALK NERDY TO US
tst2013.talkid1592_011 I WANT TO SHARE A FEW KEYS ON HOW YOU CAN DO THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN SEE THAT YOUR SCIENCE IS SEXY AND THAT YOUR ENGINEERING IS ENGAGING
tst2013.talkid1592_012 FIRST QUESTION TO ANSWER FOR US SO WHAT
tst2013.talkid1592_013 TELL US WHY YOUR SCIENCE IS RELEVANT TO US
tst2013.talkid1592_014 DON'T JUST TELL ME THAT YOU STUDY TRABECULAE BUT TELL ME THAT YOU STUDY TRABECULAE WHICH IS THE MESH LIKE STRUCTURE OF OUR BONES BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING AND TREATING OSTEOPOROSIS
tst2013.talkid1592_015 AND WHEN YOU'RE DESCRIBING YOUR SCIENCE BEWARE OF JARGON
tst2013.talkid1592_016 JARGON IS A BARRIER TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR IDEAS
tst2013.talkid1592_017 SURE YOU CAN SAY SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL BUT WHY NOT JUST SAY SPACE AND TIME WHICH IS SO MUCH MORE ACCESSIBLE TO US
tst2013.talkid1592_018 AND MAKING YOUR IDEAS ACCESSIBLE IS NOT THE SAME AS DUMBING IT DOWN
tst2013.talkid1592_019 INSTEAD AS EINSTEIN SAID MAKE EVERYTHING AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE BUT NO SIMPLER
tst2013.talkid1592_020 YOU CAN CLEARLY COMMUNICATE YOUR SCIENCE WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE IDEAS
tst2013.talkid1592_021 A FEW THINGS TO CONSIDER ARE HAVING EXAMPLES STORIES AND ANALOGIES THOSE ARE WAYS TO ENGAGE AND EXCITE US ABOUT YOUR CONTENT
tst2013.talkid1592_022 AND WHEN PRESENTING YOUR WORK DROP THE BULLET POINTS
tst2013.talkid1592_023 HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED WHY THEY'RE CALLED BULLET POINTS
tst2013.talkid1592_024 WHAT DO BULLETS DO BULLETS KILL AND THEY WILL KILL YOUR PRESENTATION
tst2013.talkid1592_025 A SLIDE LIKE THIS IS NOT ONLY BORING BUT IT RELIES TOO MUCH ON THE LANGUAGE AREA OF OUR BRAIN AND CAUSES US TO BECOME OVERWHELMED
tst2013.talkid1592_026 INSTEAD THIS EXAMPLE SLIDE BY GENEVIEVE BROWN IS MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE IT'S SHOWING THAT THE SPECIAL STRUCTURE OF TRABECULAE ARE SO STRONG THAT THEY ACTUALLY INSPIRED THE UNIQUE DESIGN OF THE EIFFEL TOWER
tst2013.talkid1592_027 AND THE TRICK HERE IS TO USE A SINGLE READABLE SENTENCE THAT THE AUDIENCE CAN KEY INTO IF THEY GET A BIT LOST AND THEN PROVIDE VISUALS WHICH APPEAL TO OUR OTHER SENSES AND CREATE A DEEPER SENSE OF UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S BEING DESCRIBED
tst2013.talkid1592_028 SO I THINK THESE ARE JUST A FEW KEYS THAT CAN HELP THE REST OF US TO OPEN THAT DOOR AND SEE THE WONDERLAND THAT IS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
tst2013.talkid1592_029 AND BECAUSE THE ENGINEERS THAT I'VE WORKED WITH HAVE TAUGHT ME TO BECOME REALLY IN TOUCH WITH MY INNER NERD I WANT TO SUMMARIZE WITH AN EQUATION
tst2013.talkid1592_030 TAKE YOUR SCIENCE SUBTRACT YOUR BULLET POINTS AND YOUR JARGON DIVIDE BY RELEVANCE MEANING SHARE WHAT'S RELEVANT TO THE AUDIENCE AND MULTIPLY IT BY THE PASSION THAT YOU HAVE FOR THIS INCREDIBLE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING AND THAT IS GOING TO EQUAL INCREDIBLE INTERACTIONS THAT ARE FULL OF UNDERSTANDING
tst2013.talkid1592_031 AND SO SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS WHEN YOU'VE SOLVED THIS EQUATION BY ALL MEANS TALK NERDY TO ME
tst2013.talkid1592_032 THANK YOU
tst2013.talkid1600_000 TODAY I HAVE JUST ONE REQUEST
tst2013.talkid1600_001 PLEASE DON'T TELL ME I'M NORMAL
tst2013.talkid1600_002 NOW I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO MY BROTHERS
tst2013.talkid1600_003 REMI IS TWENTY TWO TALL AND VERY HANDSOME
tst2013.talkid1600_004 HE'S SPEECHLESS BUT HE COMMUNICATES JOY IN A WAY THAT SOME OF THE BEST ORATORS CANNOT
tst2013.talkid1600_005 REMI KNOWS WHAT LOVE IS
tst2013.talkid1600_006 HE SHARES IT UNCONDITIONALLY AND HE SHARES IT REGARDLESS
tst2013.talkid1600_007 HE'S NOT GREEDY HE DOESN'T SEE SKIN COLOR
tst2013.talkid1600_008 HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES AND GET THIS HE HAS NEVER TOLD A LIE
tst2013.talkid1600_009 WHEN HE SINGS SONGS FROM OUR CHILDHOOD ATTEMPTING WORDS THAT NOT EVEN I COULD REMEMBER HE REMINDS ME OF ONE THING HOW LITTLE WE KNOW ABOUT THE MIND AND HOW WONDERFUL THE UNKNOWN MUST BE
tst2013.talkid1600_010 SAMUEL IS SIXTEEN HE'S TALL HE'S VERY HANDSOME
tst2013.talkid1600_011 HE HAS THE MOST IMPECCABLE MEMORY
tst2013.talkid1600_012 HE HAS A SELECTIVE ONE THOUGH
tst2013.talkid1600_013 HE DOESN'T REMEMBER IF HE STOLE MY CHOCOLATE BAR BUT HE REMEMBERS THE YEAR OF RELEASE FOR EVERY SONG ON MY IPOD CONVERSATIONS WE HAD WHEN HE WAS FOUR WEEING ON MY ARM ON THE FIRST EVER EPISODE OF TELETUBBIES AND LADY GAGA'S BIRTHDAY
tst2013.talkid1600_014 DON'T THEY SOUND INCREDIBLE
tst2013.talkid1600_015 BUT MOST PEOPLE DON'T AGREE
tst2013.talkid1600_016 AND IN FACT BECAUSE THEIR MINDS DON'T FIT INTO SOCIETY'S VERSION OF NORMAL THEY'RE OFTEN BYPASSED AND MISUNDERSTOOD
tst2013.talkid1600_017 BUT WHAT LIFTED MY HEART AND STRENGTHENED MY SOUL WAS THAT EVEN THOUGH THIS WAS THE CASE ALTHOUGH THEY WERE NOT SEEN AS ORDINARY THIS COULD ONLY MEAN ONE THING THAT THEY WERE EXTRAORDINARY AUTISTIC AND EXTRAORDINARY
tst2013.talkid1600_018 NOW FOR YOU WHO MAY BE LESS FAMILIAR WITH THE TERM AUTISM IT'S A COMPLEX BRAIN DISORDER THAT AFFECTS SOCIAL COMMUNICATION LEARNING AND SOMETIMES PHYSICAL SKILLS
tst2013.talkid1600_019 IT MANIFESTS IN EACH INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENTLY HENCE WHY REMI IS SO DIFFERENT FROM SAM
tst2013.talkid1600_020 AND ACROSS THE WORLD EVERY TWENTY MINUTES ONE NEW PERSON IS DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM AND ALTHOUGH IT'S ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS IN THE WORLD THERE IS NO KNOWN CAUSE OR CURE
tst2013.talkid1600_021 AND I CANNOT REMEMBER THE FIRST MOMENT I ENCOUNTERED AUTISM BUT I CANNOT RECALL A DAY WITHOUT IT
tst2013.talkid1600_022 I WAS JUST THREE YEARS OLD WHEN MY BROTHER CAME ALONG AND I WAS SO EXCITED THAT I HAD A NEW BEING IN MY LIFE
tst2013.talkid1600_023 AND AFTER A FEW MONTHS WENT BY I REALIZED THAT HE WAS DIFFERENT
tst2013.talkid1600_024 HE SCREAMED A LOT
tst2013.talkid1600_025 HE DIDN'T WANT TO PLAY LIKE THE OTHER BABIES DID AND IN FACT HE DIDN'T SEEM VERY INTERESTED IN ME WHATSOEVER
tst2013.talkid1600_026 REMI LIVED AND REIGNED IN HIS OWN WORLD WITH HIS OWN RULES AND HE FOUND PLEASURE IN THE SMALLEST THINGS LIKE LINING UP CARS AROUND THE ROOM AND STARING AT THE WASHING MACHINE AND EATING ANYTHING THAT CAME IN BETWEEN
tst2013.talkid1600_027 AND AS HE GREW OLDER HE GREW MORE DIFFERENT AND THE DIFFERENCES BECAME MORE OBVIOUS
tst2013.talkid1600_028 YET BEYOND THE TANTRUMS AND THE FRUSTRATION AND THE NEVER ENDING HYPERACTIVITY WAS SOMETHING REALLY UNIQUE A PURE AND INNOCENT NATURE A BOY WHO SAW THE WORLD WITHOUT PREJUDICE A HUMAN WHO HAD NEVER LIED
tst2013.talkid1600_029 EXTRAORDINARY
tst2013.talkid1600_030 NOW I CANNOT DENY THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CHALLENGING MOMENTS IN MY FAMILY MOMENTS WHERE I'VE WISHED THAT THEY WERE JUST LIKE ME
tst2013.talkid1600_031 BUT I CAST MY MIND BACK TO THE THINGS THAT THEY'VE TAUGHT ME ABOUT INDIVIDUALITY AND COMMUNICATION AND LOVE AND I REALIZE THAT THESE ARE THINGS THAT I WOULDN'T WANT TO CHANGE WITH NORMALITY
tst2013.talkid1600_032 NORMALITY OVERLOOKS THE BEAUTY THAT DIFFERENCES GIVE US AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE DIFFERENT DOESN'T MEAN THAT ONE OF US IS WRONG
tst2013.talkid1600_033 IT JUST MEANS THAT THERE'S A DIFFERENT KIND OF RIGHT
tst2013.talkid1600_034 AND IF I COULD COMMUNICATE JUST ONE THING TO REMI AND TO SAM AND TO YOU IT WOULD BE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE NORMAL
tst2013.talkid1600_035 YOU CAN BE EXTRAORDINARY
tst2013.talkid1600_036 BECAUSE AUTISTIC OR NOT THE DIFFERENCES THAT WE HAVE WE'VE GOT A GIFT EVERYONE'S GOT A GIFT INSIDE OF US AND IN ALL HONESTY THE PURSUIT OF NORMALITY IS THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE OF POTENTIAL
tst2013.talkid1600_037 THE CHANCE FOR GREATNESS FOR PROGRESS AND FOR CHANGE DIES THE MOMENT WE TRY TO BE LIKE SOMEONE ELSE
tst2013.talkid1600_038 PLEASE DON'T TELL ME I'M NORMAL
tst2013.talkid1600_039 THANK YOU
tst2013.talkid1610_000 I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT A VERY SPECIAL GROUP OF ANIMALS
tst2013.talkid1610_001 THERE ARE TEN THOUSAND SPECIES OF BIRDS IN THE WORLD
tst2013.talkid1610_002 VULTURES ARE AMONGST THE MOST THREATENED GROUP OF BIRDS
tst2013.talkid1610_003 WHEN YOU SEE A VULTURE LIKE THIS THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO YOUR MIND IS THESE ARE DISGUSTING UGLY GREEDY CREATURES THAT ARE JUST AFTER YOUR FLESH ASSOCIATED WITH POLITICIANS
tst2013.talkid1610_004 I WANT TO CHANGE THAT PERCEPTION I WANT TO CHANGE THOSE FEELINGS YOU HAVE FOR THESE BIRDS BECAUSE THEY NEED OUR SYMPATHY THEY REALLY DO
tst2013.talkid1610_005 AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY
tst2013.talkid1610_006 FIRST OF ALL WHY DO THEY HAVE SUCH A BAD PRESS
tst2013.talkid1610_007 WHEN CHARLES DARWIN WENT ACROSS THE ATLANTIC IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO ON THE BEAGLE HE SAW THE TURKEY VULTURE AND HE SAID THESE ARE DISGUSTING BIRDS WITH BALD SCARLET HEADS THAT ARE FORMED TO REVEL IN PUTRIDITY
tst2013.talkid1610_008 YOU COULD NOT GET A WORSE INSULT AND THAT FROM CHARLES DARWIN
tst2013.talkid1610_009 YOU KNOW HE CHANGED HIS MIND WHEN HE CAME BACK AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY
tst2013.talkid1610_010 THEY'VE ALSO BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH DISNEY PERSONIFIED AS GOOFY DUMB STUPID CHARACTERS
tst2013.talkid1610_011 MORE RECENTLY IF YOU'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THE KENYAN PRESS THESE ARE THE ATTRIBUTES THAT THEY ASSOCIATED THE KENYAN MPS WITH BUT I WANT TO CHALLENGE THAT
tst2013.talkid1610_012 I WANT TO CHALLENGE THAT DO YOU KNOW WHY
tst2013.talkid1610_013 BECAUSE MPS DO NOT KEEP THE ENVIRONMENT CLEAN
tst2013.talkid1610_014 MPS DO NOT HELP TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF DISEASES
tst2013.talkid1610_015 THEY ARE HARDLY MONOGAMOUS
tst2013.talkid1610_016 THEY ARE FAR FROM BEING EXTINCT
tst2013.talkid1610_017 AND MY FAVORITE IS VULTURES ARE BETTER LOOKING
tst2013.talkid1610_018 SO THERE'S TWO TYPES OF VULTURES IN THIS PLANET
tst2013.talkid1610_019 THERE ARE THE NEW WORLD VULTURES THAT ARE MAINLY FOUND IN THE AMERICAS LIKE THE CONDORS AND THE CARACARAS AND THEN THE OLD WORLD VULTURES WHERE WE HAVE SIXTEEN SPECIES FROM THESE SIXTEEN ELEVEN OF THEM ARE FACING A HIGH RISK OF EXTINCTION
tst2013.talkid1610_020 SO WHY ARE VULTURES IMPORTANT FIRST OF ALL THEY PROVIDE VITAL ECOLOGICAL SERVICES THEY CLEAN UP
tst2013.talkid1610_021 THEY'RE OUR NATURAL GARBAGE COLLECTORS
tst2013.talkid1610_022 THEY CLEAN UP CARCASSES RIGHT TO THE BONE
tst2013.talkid1610_023 THEY HELP TO KILL ALL THE BACTERIA THEY HELP ABSORB ANTHRAX THAT WOULD OTHERWISE SPREAD AND CAUSE HUGE LIVESTOCK LOSSES AND DISEASES IN OTHER ANIMALS
tst2013.talkid1610_024 RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT IN AREAS WHERE THERE ARE NO VULTURES CARCASSES TAKE UP TO THREE TO FOUR TIMES TO DECOMPOSE AND THIS HAS HUGE RAMIFICATIONS FOR THE SPREAD OF DISEASES
tst2013.talkid1610_025 VULTURES ALSO HAVE TREMENDOUS HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE
tst2013.talkid1610_026 THEY HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED IN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN CULTURE
tst2013.talkid1610_027 NEKHBET WAS THE SYMBOL OF THE PROTECTOR AND THE MOTHERHOOD AND TOGETHER WITH THE COBRA SYMBOLIZED THE UNITY BETWEEN UPPER AND LOWER EGYPT
tst2013.talkid1610_028 IN HINDU MYTHOLOGY JATAYU WAS THE VULTURE GOD AND HE RISKED HIS LIFE IN ORDER TO SAVE THE GODDESS SITA FROM THE TEN HEADED DEMON RAVANA
tst2013.talkid1610_029 IN TIBETAN CULTURE THEY ARE PERFORMING VERY IMPORTANT SKY BURIALS IN PLACES LIKE TIBET THERE ARE NO PLACES TO BURY THE DEAD OR WOOD TO CREMATE THEM SO THESE VULTURES PROVIDE A NATURAL DISPOSAL SYSTEM
tst2013.talkid1610_030 SO WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WITH VULTURES
tst2013.talkid1610_031 WE HAVE EIGHT SPECIES OF VULTURES THAT OCCUR IN KENYA OF WHICH SIX ARE HIGHLY THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION
tst2013.talkid1610_032 THE REASON IS THAT THEY'RE GETTING POISONED AND THE REASON THAT THEY'RE GETTING POISONED IS BECAUSE THERE'S HUMAN WILDLIFE CONFLICTS THE PASTORAL COMMUNITIES ARE USING THIS POISON TO TARGET PREDATORS AND IN RETURN THE VULTURES ARE FALLING VICTIM TO THIS
tst2013.talkid1610_033 IN SOUTH ASIA IN COUNTRIES LIKE INDIA AND PAKISTAN FOUR SPECIES OF VULTURES ARE LISTED AS CRITICALLY ENDANGERED WHICH MEANS THEY HAVE LESS THAN TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS TO GO EXTINCT AND THE REASON IS BECAUSE THEY ARE FALLING PREY BY CONSUMING LIVESTOCK THAT HAS BEEN TREATED WITH A PAINKILLING DRUG LIKE DICLOFENAC
tst2013.talkid1610_034 THIS DRUG HAS NOW BEEN BANNED FOR VETERINARY USE IN INDIA AND THEY HAVE TAKEN A STAND
tst2013.talkid1610_035 BECAUSE THERE ARE NO VULTURES THERE'S BEEN A SPREAD IN THE NUMBERS OF FERAL DOGS AT CARCASS DUMP SITES AND WHEN YOU HAVE FERAL DOGS YOU HAVE A HUGE TIME BOMB OF RABIES THE NUMBER OF CASES OF RABIES HAS INCREASED TREMENDOUSLY IN INDIA
tst2013.talkid1610_036 KENYA IS GOING TO HAVE ONE OF THE LARGEST WIND FARMS IN AFRICA THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THREE WIND TURBINES ARE GOING TO BE UP AT LAKE TURKANA
tst2013.talkid1610_037 I AM NOT AGAINST WIND ENERGY BUT WE NEED TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNMENTS BECAUSE WIND TURBINES DO THIS TO BIRDS THEY SLICE THEM IN HALF
tst2013.talkid1610_038 THEY ARE BIRD BLENDING MACHINES
tst2013.talkid1610_039 IN WEST AFRICA THERE'S A HORRIFIC TRADE OF DEAD VULTURES TO SERVE THE WITCHCRAFT AND THE FETISH MARKET
tst2013.talkid1610_040 SO WHAT'S BEING DONE WELL WE'RE CONDUCTING RESEARCH ON THESE BIRDS WE'RE PUTTING TRANSMITTERS ON THEM
tst2013.talkid1610_041 WE'RE TRYING TO DETERMINE THEIR BASIC ECOLOGY AND SEE WHERE THEY GO
tst2013.talkid1610_042 WE CAN SEE THAT THEY TRAVEL DIFFERENT COUNTRIES SO IF YOU FOCUS ON A PROBLEM LOCALLY IT'S NOT GOING TO HELP YOU
tst2013.talkid1610_043 WE NEED TO WORK WITH GOVERNMENTS IN REGIONAL LEVELS
tst2013.talkid1610_044 WE'RE WORKING WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES
tst2013.talkid1610_045 WE'RE TALKING TO THEM ABOUT APPRECIATING VULTURES ABOUT THE NEED FROM WITHIN TO APPRECIATE THESE WONDERFUL CREATURES AND THE SERVICES THAT THEY PROVIDE
tst2013.talkid1610_046 HOW CAN YOU HELP YOU CAN BECOME ACTIVE MAKE NOISE YOU CAN WRITE A LETTER TO YOUR GOVERNMENT AND TELL THEM THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THESE VERY MISUNDERSTOOD CREATURES VOLUNTEER YOUR TIME TO SPREAD THE WORD SPREAD THE WORD
tst2013.talkid1610_047 WHEN YOU WALK OUT OF THIS ROOM YOU WILL BE INFORMED ABOUT VULTURES BUT SPEAK TO YOUR FAMILIES TO YOUR CHILDREN TO YOUR NEIGHBORS ABOUT VULTURES
tst2013.talkid1610_048 THEY ARE VERY GRACEFUL CHARLES DARWIN SAID HE CHANGED HIS MIND BECAUSE HE WATCHED THEM FLY EFFORTLESSLY WITHOUT ENERGY IN THE SKIES
tst2013.talkid1610_049 KENYA THIS WORLD WILL BE MUCH POORER WITHOUT THESE WONDERFUL SPECIES
tst2013.talkid1610_050 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
tst2013.talkid1617_000 EVERYTHING I DO AND EVERYTHING I DO PROFESSIONALLY MY LIFE HAS BEEN SHAPED BY SEVEN YEARS OF WORK AS A YOUNG MAN IN AFRICA
tst2013.talkid1617_001 FROM NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE TO NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN I LOOK YOUNG BUT I'M NOT I WORKED IN ZAMBIA KENYA IVORY COAST ALGERIA SOMALIA IN PROJECTS OF TECHNICAL COOPERATION WITH AFRICAN COUNTRIES
tst2013.talkid1617_002 I WORKED FOR AN ITALIAN NGO AND EVERY SINGLE PROJECT THAT WE SET UP IN AFRICA FAILED
tst2013.talkid1617_003 AND I WAS DISTRAUGHT
tst2013.talkid1617_004 I THOUGHT AGE TWENTY ONE THAT WE ITALIANS WERE GOOD PEOPLE AND WE WERE DOING GOOD WORK IN AFRICA
tst2013.talkid1617_005 INSTEAD EVERYTHING WE TOUCHED WE KILLED
tst2013.talkid1617_006 OUR FIRST PROJECT THE ONE THAT HAS INSPIRED MY FIRST BOOK RIPPLES FROM THE ZAMBEZI WAS A PROJECT WHERE WE ITALIANS DECIDED TO TEACH ZAMBIAN PEOPLE HOW TO GROW FOOD
tst2013.talkid1617_007 SO WE ARRIVED THERE WITH ITALIAN SEEDS IN SOUTHERN ZAMBIA IN THIS ABSOLUTELY MAGNIFICENT VALLEY GOING DOWN TO THE ZAMBEZI RIVER AND WE TAUGHT THE LOCAL PEOPLE HOW TO GROW ITALIAN TOMATOES AND ZUCCHINI AND
tst2013.talkid1617_008 AND OF COURSE THE LOCAL PEOPLE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST IN DOING THAT SO WE PAID THEM TO COME AND WORK AND SOMETIMES THEY WOULD SHOW UP
tst2013.talkid1617_009 AND WE WERE AMAZED THAT THE LOCAL PEOPLE IN SUCH FERTILE VALLEY WOULD NOT HAVE ANY AGRICULTURE
tst2013.talkid1617_010 BUT INSTEAD OF ASKING THEM HOW COME THEY WERE NOT GROWING ANYTHING WE SIMPLY SAID THANK GOD WE'RE HERE
tst2013.talkid1617_011 JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME TO SAVE THE ZAMBIAN PEOPLE FROM STARVATION
tst2013.talkid1617_012 AND OF COURSE EVERYTHING IN AFRICA GREW BEAUTIFULLY
tst2013.talkid1617_013 WE HAD THESE MAGNIFICENT TOMATOES IN ITALY A TOMATO WOULD GROW TO THIS SIZE IN ZAMBIA TO THIS SIZE
tst2013.talkid1617_014 AND WE COULD NOT BELIEVE AND WE WERE TELLING THE ZAMBIANS LOOK HOW EASY AGRICULTURE IS
tst2013.talkid1617_015 WHEN THE TOMATOES WERE NICE AND RIPE AND RED OVERNIGHT SOME TWO HUNDRED HIPPOS CAME OUT FROM THE RIVER AND THEY ATE EVERYTHING
tst2013.talkid1617_016 AND WE SAID TO THE ZAMBIANS MY GOD THE HIPPOS
tst2013.talkid1617_017 AND THE ZAMBIANS SAID YES THAT'S WHY WE HAVE NO AGRICULTURE HERE
tst2013.talkid1617_018 WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US YOU NEVER ASKED
tst2013.talkid1617_019 I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY US ITALIANS BLUNDERING AROUND AFRICA BUT THEN I SAW WHAT THE AMERICANS WERE DOING WHAT THE ENGLISH WERE DOING WHAT THE FRENCH WERE DOING AND AFTER SEEING WHAT THEY WERE DOING I BECAME QUITE PROUD OF OUR PROJECT IN ZAMBIA
tst2013.talkid1617_020 BECAUSE YOU SEE AT LEAST WE FED THE HIPPOS
tst2013.talkid1617_021 YOU SHOULD SEE THE RUBBISH YOU SHOULD SEE THE RUBBISH THAT WE HAVE BESTOWED ON UNSUSPECTING AFRICAN PEOPLE
tst2013.talkid1617_022 YOU WANT TO READ THE BOOK READ DEAD AID BY DAMBISA MOYO ZAMBIAN WOMAN ECONOMIST
tst2013.talkid1617_023 THE BOOK WAS PUBLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND NINE
tst2013.talkid1617_024 WE WESTERN DONOR COUNTRY HAVE GIVEN THE AFRICAN CONTINENT TWO TRILLION DOLLARS AMERICAN IN THE LAST FIFTY YEARS
tst2013.talkid1617_025 I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU THE DAMAGE THAT THAT MONEY HAS DONE
tst2013.talkid1617_026 JUST GO AND READ HER BOOK
tst2013.talkid1617_027 READ IT FROM AN AFRICAN WOMAN THE DAMAGE THAT WE HAVE DONE
tst2013.talkid1617_028 WE WESTERN PEOPLE ARE IMPERIALIST COLONIALIST MISSIONARIES AND THERE ARE ONLY TWO WAYS WE DEAL WITH PEOPLE WE EITHER PATRONIZE THEM OR WE ARE PATERNALISTIC
tst2013.talkid1617_029 THE TWO WORDS COME FROM THE LATIN ROOT PATER WHICH MEANS FATHER
tst2013.talkid1617_030 BUT THEY MEAN TWO DIFFERENT THINGS
tst2013.talkid1617_031 PATERNALISTIC I TREAT ANYBODY FROM A DIFFERENT CULTURE AS IF THEY WERE MY CHILDREN I LOVE YOU SO MUCH
tst2013.talkid1617_032 PATRONIZING I TREAT EVERYBODY FROM ANOTHER CULTURE AS IF THEY WERE MY SERVANTS
tst2013.talkid1617_033 THAT'S WHY THE WHITE PEOPLE IN AFRICA ARE CALLED BWANA BOSS
tst2013.talkid1617_034 I WAS GIVEN A SLAP IN THE FACE READING A BOOK SMALL IS BEAUTIFUL WRITTEN BY SCHUMACHER WHO SAID ABOVE ALL IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IF PEOPLE DO NOT WISH TO BE HELPED LEAVE THEM ALONE
tst2013.talkid1617_035 THIS SHOULD BE THE FIRST PRINCIPLE OF AID
tst2013.talkid1617_036 THE FIRST PRINCIPLE OF AID IS RESPECT
tst2013.talkid1617_037 THIS MORNING THE GENTLEMAN WHO OPENED THIS CONFERENCE LAY A STICK ON THE FLOOR AND SAID CAN WE CAN YOU IMAGINE A CITY THAT IS NOT NEOCOLONIAL
tst2013.talkid1617_038 I DECIDED WHEN I WAS TWENTY SEVEN YEARS OLD TO ONLY RESPOND TO PEOPLE AND I INVENTED A SYSTEM CALLED ENTERPRISE FACILITATION WHERE YOU NEVER INITIATE ANYTHING YOU NEVER MOTIVATE ANYBODY BUT YOU BECOME A SERVANT OF THE LOCAL PASSION THE SERVANT OF LOCAL PEOPLE WHO HAVE A DREAM TO BECOME A BETTER PERSON
tst2013.talkid1617_039 SO WHAT YOU DO YOU SHUT UP
tst2013.talkid1617_040 YOU NEVER ARRIVE IN A COMMUNITY WITH ANY IDEAS AND YOU SIT WITH THE LOCAL PEOPLE
tst2013.talkid1617_041 WE DON'T WORK FROM OFFICES
tst2013.talkid1617_042 WE MEET AT THE CAFE WE MEET AT THE PUB
tst2013.talkid1617_043 WE HAVE ZERO INFRASTRUCTURE
tst2013.talkid1617_044 AND WHAT WE DO WE BECOME FRIENDS AND WE FIND OUT WHAT THAT PERSON WANTS TO DO
tst2013.talkid1617_045 THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS PASSION
tst2013.talkid1617_046 YOU CAN GIVE SOMEBODY AN IDEA
tst2013.talkid1617_047 IF THAT PERSON DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
tst2013.talkid1617_048 THE PASSION THAT THE PERSON HAS FOR HER OWN GROWTH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
tst2013.talkid1617_049 THE PASSION THAT THAT MAN HAS FOR HIS OWN PERSONAL GROWTH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
tst2013.talkid1617_050 AND THEN WE HELP THEM TO GO AND FIND THE KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE NOBODY IN THE WORLD CAN SUCCEED ALONE
tst2013.talkid1617_051 THE PERSON WITH THE IDEA MAY NOT HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE BUT THE KNOWLEDGE IS AVAILABLE
tst2013.talkid1617_052 SO YEARS AND YEARS AGO I HAD THIS IDEA WHY DON'T WE FOR ONCE INSTEAD OF ARRIVING IN THE COMMUNITY TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT TO DO WHY DON'T FOR ONCE LISTEN TO THEM BUT NOT IN COMMUNITY MEETINGS
tst2013.talkid1617_053 LET ME TELL YOU A SECRET
tst2013.talkid1617_054 THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH COMMUNITY MEETINGS
tst2013.talkid1617_055 ENTREPRENEURS NEVER COME AND THEY NEVER TELL YOU IN A PUBLIC MEETING WHAT THEY WANT TO DO WITH THEIR OWN MONEY WHAT OPPORTUNITY THEY HAVE IDENTIFIED
tst2013.talkid1617_056 SO PLANNING HAS THIS BLIND SPOT
tst2013.talkid1617_057 THE SMARTEST PEOPLE IN YOUR COMMUNITY YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW BECAUSE THEY DON'T COME TO YOUR PUBLIC MEETINGS
tst2013.talkid1617_058 WHAT WE DO WE WORK ONE ON ONE AND TO WORK ONE ON ONE YOU HAVE TO CREATE A SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT DOESN'T EXIST
tst2013.talkid1617_059 YOU HAVE TO CREATE A NEW PROFESSION
tst2013.talkid1617_060 THE PROFESSION IS THE FAMILY DOCTOR OF ENTERPRISE THE FAMILY DOCTOR OF BUSINESS WHO SITS WITH YOU IN YOUR HOUSE AT YOUR KITCHEN TABLE AT THE CAFE AND HELPS YOU FIND THE RESOURCES TO TRANSFORM YOUR PASSION INTO A WAY TO MAKE A LIVING
tst2013.talkid1617_061 I STARTED THIS AS A TRYOUT IN IN ESPERANCE IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA
tst2013.talkid1617_062 I WAS A DOING A PHD AT THE TIME TRYING TO GO AWAY FROM THIS PATRONIZING BULLSHIT THAT WE ARRIVE AND TELL YOU WHAT TO DO
tst2013.talkid1617_063 AND SO WHAT I DID IN ESPERANCE THAT FIRST YEAR WAS TO JUST WALK THE STREETS AND IN THE IN THREE DAYS I HAD MY FIRST CLIENT AND I HELPED THIS FIRST GUY WHO WAS SMOKING FISH FROM A GARAGE WAS A MAORI GUY AND I HELPED HIM TO SELL TO THE RESTAURANT IN PERTH TO GET ORGANIZED AND THEN THE FISHERMEN CAME TO ME TO SAY YOU THE GUY WHO HELPED MAORI CAN YOU HELP US
tst2013.talkid1617_064 AND I HELPED THESE FIVE FISHERMEN TO WORK TOGETHER AND GET THIS BEAUTIFUL TUNA NOT TO THE CANNERY IN ALBANY FOR SIXTY CENTS A KILO BUT WE FOUND A WAY TO TAKE THE FISH FOR SUSHI TO JAPAN FOR FIFTEEN DOLLARS A KILO AND THE FARMERS CAME TO TALK TO ME SAY HEY YOU HELPED THEM CAN YOU HELP US
tst2013.talkid1617_065 IN A YEAR I HAD TWENTY SEVEN PROJECTS GOING ON AND THE GOVERNMENT CAME TO SEE ME TO SAY HOW CAN YOU DO THAT
tst2013.talkid1617_066 HOW CAN YOU DO AND I SAID I DO SOMETHING VERY VERY VERY DIFFICULT
tst2013.talkid1617_067 I SHUT UP AND LISTEN TO THEM
tst2013.talkid1617_068 SO SO THE GOVERNMENT SAYS DO IT AGAIN
tst2013.talkid1617_069 WE'VE DONE IT IN THREE HUNDRED COMMUNITIES AROUND THE WORLD
tst2013.talkid1617_070 WE HAVE HELPED TO START FORTY THOUSAND BUSINESSES
tst2013.talkid1617_071 THERE IS A NEW GENERATION OF ENTREPRENEURS WHO ARE DYING OF SOLITUDE
tst2013.talkid1617_072 PETER DRUCKER ONE OF THE GREATEST MANAGEMENT CONSULTANTS IN HISTORY DIED AGED NINETY SIX A FEW YEARS AGO
tst2013.talkid1617_073 PETER DRUCKER WAS A PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY BEFORE BECOMING INVOLVED IN BUSINESS AND THIS IS WHAT PETER DRUCKER SAYS PLANNING IS ACTUALLY INCOMPATIBLE WITH AN ENTREPRENEURIAL SOCIETY AND ECONOMY
tst2013.talkid1617_074 PLANNING IS THE KISS OF DEATH OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP
tst2013.talkid1617_075 SO NOW YOU'RE REBUILDING CHRISTCHURCH WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THE SMARTEST PEOPLE IN CHRISTCHURCH WANT TO DO WITH THEIR OWN MONEY AND THEIR OWN ENERGY
tst2013.talkid1617_076 YOU HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO GET THESE PEOPLE TO COME AND TALK TO YOU
tst2013.talkid1617_077 YOU HAVE TO OFFER THEM CONFIDENTIALITY PRIVACY YOU HAVE TO BE FANTASTIC AT HELPING THEM AND THEN THEY WILL COME AND THEY WILL COME IN DROVES
tst2013.talkid1617_078 IN A COMMUNITY OF TEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WE GET TWO HUNDRED CLIENTS
tst2013.talkid1617_079 CAN YOU IMAGINE A COMMUNITY OF FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE THE INTELLIGENCE AND THE PASSION
tst2013.talkid1617_080 WHICH PRESENTATION HAVE YOU APPLAUDED THE MOST THIS MORNING
tst2013.talkid1617_081 LOCAL PASSIONATE PEOPLE THAT'S WHO YOU HAVE APPLAUDED
tst2013.talkid1617_082 SO WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS WHERE IT'S AT
tst2013.talkid1617_083 WE ARE AT THE END OF THE FIRST INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION NONRENEWABLE FOSSIL FUELS MANUFACTURING AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE HAVE SYSTEMS WHICH ARE NOT SUSTAINABLE
tst2013.talkid1617_084 THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE IS NOT SUSTAINABLE
tst2013.talkid1617_085 FREON WAY OF MAINTAINING THINGS IS NOT SUSTAINABLE
tst2013.talkid1617_086 WHAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT IS AT HOW WE FEED CURE EDUCATE TRANSPORT COMMUNICATE FOR SEVEN BILLION PEOPLE IN A SUSTAINABLE WAY
tst2013.talkid1617_087 THE TECHNOLOGIES DO NOT EXIST TO DO THAT
tst2013.talkid1617_088 WHO IS GOING TO INVENT THE TECHNOLOGY FOR THE GREEN REVOLUTION UNIVERSITIES FORGET ABOUT IT
tst2013.talkid1617_089 GOVERNMENT FORGET ABOUT IT
tst2013.talkid1617_090 IT WILL BE ENTREPRENEURS AND THEY'RE DOING IT NOW
tst2013.talkid1617_091 THERE'S A LOVELY STORY THAT I READ IN A IN A FUTURIST MAGAZINE MANY MANY YEARS AGO
tst2013.talkid1617_092 THERE WAS A GROUP OF EXPERTS WHO WERE INVITED TO DISCUSS THE FUTURE OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY
tst2013.talkid1617_093 AND IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE CAME TOGETHER AND THEY ALL SPECULATED ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THE CITY OF NEW YORK IN ONE HUNDRED YEARS AND THE CONCLUSION WAS UNANIMOUS THE CITY OF NEW YORK WOULD NOT EXIST IN ONE HUNDRED YEARS
tst2013.talkid1617_094 WHY BECAUSE THEY LOOKED AT THE CURVE AND SAID IF THE POPULATION KEEPS GROWING AT THIS RATE TO MOVE THE POPULATION OF NEW YORK AROUND THEY WOULD HAVE NEEDED SIX MILLION HORSES AND THE MANURE CREATED BY SIX MILLION HORSES WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE TO DEAL WITH
tst2013.talkid1617_095 THEY WERE ALREADY DROWNING IN MANURE
tst2013.talkid1617_096 SO EIGHTEEN SIXTY THEY ARE SEEING THIS DIRTY TECHNOLOGY THAT IS GOING TO CHOKE THE LIFE OUT OF NEW YORK
tst2013.talkid1617_097 SO WHAT HAPPENS IN FORTY YEARS' TIME IN THE YEAR NINETEEN HUNDRED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA THERE WERE ONE THOUSAND AND ONE CAR MANUFACTURING COMPANIES ONE THOUSAND AND ONE
tst2013.talkid1617_098 THE IDEA OF FINDING A DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY HAD ABSOLUTELY TAKEN OVER AND THERE WERE TINY TINY LITTLE FACTORIES IN BACKWATERS
tst2013.talkid1617_099 DEARBORN MICHIGAN HENRY FORD
tst2013.talkid1617_100 HOWEVER THERE IS A SECRET TO WORK WITH ENTREPRENEURS
tst2013.talkid1617_101 FIRST YOU HAVE TO OFFER THEM CONFIDENTIALITY
tst2013.talkid1617_102 OTHERWISE THEY DON'T COME AND TALK TO YOU
tst2013.talkid1617_103 THEN YOU HAVE TO OFFER THEM ABSOLUTE DEDICATED PASSIONATE SERVICE TO THEM
tst2013.talkid1617_104 AND THEN YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM THE TRUTH ABOUT ENTREPRENEURSHIP
tst2013.talkid1617_105 THE SMALLEST COMPANY THE BIGGEST COMPANY HAS TO BE CAPABLE OF DOING THREE THINGS BEAUTIFULLY THE PRODUCT THAT YOU WANT TO SELL HAS TO BE FANTASTIC YOU HAVE TO HAVE FANTASTIC MARKETING AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE TREMENDOUS FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
tst2013.talkid1617_106 GUESS WHAT
tst2013.talkid1617_107 WE HAVE NEVER MET A SINGLE HUMAN BEING IN THE WORLD WHO CAN MAKE IT SELL IT AND LOOK AFTER THE MONEY
tst2013.talkid1617_108 DOESN'T EXIST
tst2013.talkid1617_109 THIS PERSON HAS NEVER BEEN BORN
tst2013.talkid1617_110 WE'VE DONE THE RESEARCH AND WE HAVE LOOKED AT THE ONE HUNDRED ICONIC COMPANIES OF THE WORLD CARNEGIE WESTINGHOUSE EDISON FORD ALL THE NEW COMPANIES GOOGLE YAHOO
tst2013.talkid1617_111 THERE'S ONLY ONE THING THAT ALL THE SUCCESSFUL COMPANY IN THE WORLD HAVE IN COMMON ONLY ONE NONE WERE STARTED BY ONE PERSON
tst2013.talkid1617_112 NOW WE TEACH ENTREPRENEURSHIP TO SIXTEEN YEARS OLD IN NORTHUMBERLAND AND WE START THE CLASS BY GIVING THEM THE FIRST TWO PAGES OF RICHARD BRANSON'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY AND THE TASK OF THE SIXTEEN YEARS OLD IS TO UNDERLINE IN THE FIRST TWO PAGES OF RICHARD BRANSON'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY HOW MANY TIMES RICHARD USES THE WORD I AND HOW MANY TIMES HE USES THE WORD WE
tst2013.talkid1617_113 NEVER THE WORD I AND THE WORD WE THIRTY TWO TIMES

tst2013.talkid1617_122 THANK YOU
tst2013.talkid1634_000 PHOTOGRAPHY HAS BEEN MY PASSION EVER SINCE I WAS OLD ENOUGH TO PICK UP A CAMERA BUT TODAY I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU THE FIFTEEN MOST TREASURED PHOTOS OF MINE AND I DIDN'T TAKE ANY OF THEM
tst2013.talkid1634_001 THERE WERE NO ART DIRECTORS NO STYLISTS NO CHANCE FOR RESHOOTS NOT EVEN ANY REGARD FOR LIGHTING
tst2013.talkid1634_002 IN FACT MOST OF THEM WERE TAKEN BY RANDOM TOURISTS
tst2013.talkid1634_003 MY STORY BEGINS WHEN I WAS IN NEW YORK CITY FOR A SPEAKING ENGAGEMENT AND MY WIFE TOOK THIS PICTURE OF ME HOLDING MY DAUGHTER ON HER FIRST BIRTHDAY WE WERE ON THE CORNER OF FIFTY SEVENTH AND FIFTH
tst2013.talkid1634_004 WE HAPPENED TO BE BACK IN NEW YORK EXACTLY A YEAR LATER SO WE DECIDED TO TAKE THE SAME PICTURE
tst2013.talkid1634_005 WELL YOU CAN SEE WHERE THIS IS GOING
tst2013.talkid1634_006 APPROACHING MY DAUGHTER'S THIRD BIRTHDAY MY WIFE SAID HEY WHY DON'T YOU TAKE SABINA BACK TO NEW YORK AND MAKE IT A FATHER DAUGHTER TRIP AND CONTINUE THE RITUAL
tst2013.talkid1634_007 THIS IS WHEN WE STARTED ASKING PASSING TOURISTS TO TAKE THE PICTURE
tst2013.talkid1634_008 YOU KNOW IT'S REMARKABLE HOW UNIVERSAL THE GESTURE IS OF HANDING YOUR CAMERA TO A TOTAL STRANGER
tst2013.talkid1634_009 NO ONE'S EVER REFUSED AND LUCKILY NO ONE'S EVER RUN OFF WITH OUR CAMERA
tst2013.talkid1634_010 BACK THEN WE HAD NO IDEA HOW MUCH THIS TRIP WOULD CHANGE OUR LIVES
tst2013.talkid1634_011 IT'S REALLY BECOME SACRED TO US
tst2013.talkid1634_012 THIS ONE WAS TAKEN JUST WEEKS AFTER NINE ELEVEN AND I FOUND MYSELF TRYING TO EXPLAIN WHAT HAD HAPPENED THAT DAY IN WAYS A FIVE YEAR OLD COULD UNDERSTAND
tst2013.talkid1634_013 SO THESE PHOTOS ARE FAR MORE THAN PROXIES FOR A SINGLE MOMENT OR EVEN A SPECIFIC TRIP
tst2013.talkid1634_014 THEY'RE ALSO WAYS FOR US TO FREEZE TIME FOR ONE WEEK IN OCTOBER AND REFLECT ON OUR TIMES AND HOW WE CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND NOT JUST PHYSICALLY BUT IN EVERY WAY
tst2013.talkid1634_015 BECAUSE WHILE WE TAKE THE SAME PHOTO OUR PERSPECTIVES CHANGE AND SHE REACHES NEW MILESTONES AND I GET TO SEE LIFE THROUGH HER EYES AND HOW SHE INTERACTS WITH AND SEES EVERYTHING
tst2013.talkid1634_016 THIS VERY FOCUSED TIME WE GET TO SPEND TOGETHER IS SOMETHING WE CHERISH AND ANTICIPATE THE ENTIRE YEAR
tst2013.talkid1634_017 RECENTLY ON ONE TRIP WE WERE WALKING AND SHE STOPS DEAD IN HER TRACKS AND SHE POINTS TO A RED AWNING OF THE DOLL STORE THAT SHE LOVED WHEN SHE WAS LITTLE ON OUR EARLIER TRIPS
tst2013.talkid1634_018 AND SHE DESCRIBES TO ME THE FEELING SHE FELT AS A FIVE YEAR OLD STANDING IN THAT EXACT SPOT
tst2013.talkid1634_019 SHE SAID SHE REMEMBERS HER HEART BURSTING OUT OF HER CHEST WHEN SHE SAW THAT PLACE FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME NINE YEARS EARLIER
tst2013.talkid1634_020 AND NOW WHAT SHE'S LOOKING AT IN NEW YORK ARE COLLEGES BECAUSE SHE'S DETERMINED TO GO TO SCHOOL IN NEW YORK
tst2013.talkid1634_021 AND IT HIT ME ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE ALL MAKE ARE MEMORIES
tst2013.talkid1634_022 SO I WANT TO SHARE THE IDEA OF TAKING AN ACTIVE ROLE IN CONSCIOUSLY CREATING MEMORIES
tst2013.talkid1634_023 I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT ASIDE FROM THESE FIFTEEN SHOTS I'M NOT IN MANY OF THE FAMILY PHOTOS
tst2013.talkid1634_024 I'M ALWAYS THE ONE TAKING THE PICTURE
tst2013.talkid1634_025 SO I WANT TO ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TODAY TO GET IN THE SHOT AND DON'T HESITATE TO GO UP TO SOMEONE AND ASK WILL YOU TAKE OUR PICTURE
tst2013.talkid1634_026 THANK YOU
tst2013.talkid1637_000 ONE DAY IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN THREE THOUSAND MILES OFF THE COAST OF CHILE IN ONE OF THE MOST REMOTE REGIONS OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN TWENTY AMERICAN SAILORS WATCHED THEIR SHIP FLOOD WITH SEAWATER
tst2013.talkid1637_001 THEY'D BEEN STRUCK BY A SPERM WHALE WHICH HAD RIPPED A CATASTROPHIC HOLE IN THE SHIP'S HULL
tst2013.talkid1637_002 AS THEIR SHIP BEGAN TO SINK BENEATH THE SWELLS THE MEN HUDDLED TOGETHER IN THREE SMALL WHALEBOATS
tst2013.talkid1637_003 THESE MEN WERE TEN THOUSAND MILES FROM HOME MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND MILES FROM THE NEAREST SCRAP OF LAND
tst2013.talkid1637_004 IN THEIR SMALL BOATS THEY CARRIED ONLY RUDIMENTARY NAVIGATIONAL EQUIPMENT AND LIMITED SUPPLIES OF FOOD AND WATER
tst2013.talkid1637_005 THESE WERE THE MEN OF THE WHALE SHIP ESSEX WHOSE STORY WOULD LATER INSPIRE PARTS OF MOBY DICK
tst2013.talkid1637_006 EVEN IN TODAY'S WORLD THEIR SITUATION WOULD BE REALLY DIRE BUT THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH WORSE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THEN
tst2013.talkid1637_007 NO ONE ON LAND HAD ANY IDEA THAT ANYTHING HAD GONE WRONG
tst2013.talkid1637_008 NO SEARCH PARTY WAS COMING TO LOOK FOR THESE MEN
tst2013.talkid1637_009 SO MOST OF US HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED A SITUATION AS FRIGHTENING AS THE ONE IN WHICH THESE SAILORS FOUND THEMSELVES BUT WE ALL KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE AFRAID
tst2013.talkid1637_010 WE KNOW HOW FEAR FEELS BUT I'M NOT SURE WE SPEND ENOUGH TIME THINKING ABOUT WHAT OUR FEARS MEAN
tst2013.talkid1637_011 AS WE GROW UP WE'RE OFTEN ENCOURAGED TO THINK OF FEAR AS A WEAKNESS JUST ANOTHER CHILDISH THING TO DISCARD LIKE BABY TEETH OR ROLLER SKATES
tst2013.talkid1637_012 AND I THINK IT'S NO ACCIDENT THAT WE THINK THIS WAY
tst2013.talkid1637_013 NEUROSCIENTISTS HAVE ACTUALLY SHOWN THAT HUMAN BEINGS ARE HARD WIRED TO BE OPTIMISTS
tst2013.talkid1637_014 SO MAYBE THAT'S WHY WE THINK OF FEAR SOMETIMES AS A DANGER IN AND OF ITSELF
tst2013.talkid1637_015 DON'T WORRY WE LIKE TO SAY TO ONE ANOTHER DON'T PANIC
tst2013.talkid1637_016 IN ENGLISH FEAR IS SOMETHING WE CONQUER
tst2013.talkid1637_017 IT'S SOMETHING WE FIGHT IT'S SOMETHING WE OVERCOME
tst2013.talkid1637_018 BUT WHAT IF WE LOOKED AT FEAR IN A FRESH WAY
tst2013.talkid1637_019 WHAT IF WE THOUGHT OF FEAR AS AN AMAZING ACT OF THE IMAGINATION SOMETHING THAT CAN BE AS PROFOUND AND INSIGHTFUL AS STORYTELLING ITSELF
tst2013.talkid1637_020 IT'S EASIEST TO SEE THIS LINK BETWEEN FEAR AND THE IMAGINATION IN YOUNG CHILDREN WHOSE FEARS ARE OFTEN EXTRAORDINARILY VIVID
tst2013.talkid1637_021 WHEN I WAS A CHILD I LIVED IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS YOU KNOW MOSTLY A VERY NICE PLACE TO LIVE BUT FOR ME AS A CHILD CALIFORNIA COULD ALSO BE A LITTLE SCARY
tst2013.talkid1637_022 I REMEMBER HOW FRIGHTENING IT WAS TO SEE THE CHANDELIER THAT HUNG ABOVE OUR DINING TABLE SWING BACK AND FORTH DURING EVERY MINOR EARTHQUAKE AND I SOMETIMES COULDN'T SLEEP AT NIGHT TERRIFIED THAT THE BIG ONE MIGHT STRIKE WHILE WE WERE SLEEPING
tst2013.talkid1637_023 AND WHAT WE SAY ABOUT KIDS WHO HAVE FEARS LIKE THAT IS THAT THEY HAVE A VIVID IMAGINATION
tst2013.talkid1637_024 BUT AT A CERTAIN POINT MOST OF US LEARN TO LEAVE THESE KINDS OF VISIONS BEHIND AND GROW UP
tst2013.talkid1637_025 WE LEARN THAT THERE ARE NO MONSTERS HIDING UNDER THE BED AND NOT EVERY EARTHQUAKE BRINGS BUILDINGS DOWN
tst2013.talkid1637_026 BUT MAYBE IT'S NO COINCIDENCE THAT SOME OF OUR MOST CREATIVE MINDS FAIL TO LEAVE THESE KINDS OF FEARS BEHIND AS ADULTS
tst2013.talkid1637_027 THE SAME INCREDIBLE IMAGINATIONS THAT PRODUCED THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES JANE EYRE AND THE REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS PAST ALSO GENERATED INTENSE WORRIES THAT HAUNTED THE ADULT LIVES OF CHARLES DARWIN CHARLOTTE BRONTE AND MARCEL PROUST
tst2013.talkid1637_028 SO THE QUESTION IS WHAT CAN THE REST OF US LEARN ABOUT FEAR FROM VISIONARIES AND YOUNG CHILDREN
tst2013.talkid1637_029 WELL LET'S RETURN TO THE YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FOR A MOMENT TO THE SITUATION FACING THE CREW OF THE WHALESHIP ESSEX
tst2013.talkid1637_030 LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE FEARS THAT THEIR IMAGINATIONS WERE GENERATING AS THEY DRIFTED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PACIFIC
tst2013.talkid1637_031 TWENTY FOUR HOURS HAD NOW PASSED SINCE THE CAPSIZING OF THE SHIP
tst2013.talkid1637_032 THE TIME HAD COME FOR THE MEN TO MAKE A PLAN BUT THEY HAD VERY FEW OPTIONS
tst2013.talkid1637_033 IN HIS FASCINATING ACCOUNT OF THE DISASTER NATHANIEL PHILBRICK WROTE THAT THESE MEN WERE JUST ABOUT AS FAR FROM LAND AS IT WAS POSSIBLE TO BE ANYWHERE ON EARTH
tst2013.talkid1637_034 THE MEN KNEW THAT THE NEAREST ISLANDS THEY COULD REACH WERE THE MARQUESAS ISLANDS ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED MILES AWAY
tst2013.talkid1637_035 BUT THEY'D HEARD SOME FRIGHTENING RUMORS
tst2013.talkid1637_036 THEY'D BEEN TOLD THAT THESE ISLANDS AND SEVERAL OTHERS NEARBY WERE POPULATED BY CANNIBALS
tst2013.talkid1637_037 SO THE MEN PICTURED COMING ASHORE ONLY TO BE MURDERED AND EATEN FOR DINNER
tst2013.talkid1637_038 ANOTHER POSSIBLE DESTINATION WAS HAWAII BUT GIVEN THE SEASON THE CAPTAIN WAS AFRAID THEY'D BE STRUCK BY SEVERE STORMS
tst2013.talkid1637_039 NOW THE LAST OPTION WAS THE LONGEST AND THE MOST DIFFICULT TO SAIL FIFTEEN HUNDRED MILES DUE SOUTH IN HOPES OF REACHING A CERTAIN BAND OF WINDS THAT COULD EVENTUALLY PUSH THEM TOWARD THE COAST OF SOUTH AMERICA
tst2013.talkid1637_040 BUT THEY KNEW THAT THE SHEER LENGTH OF THIS JOURNEY WOULD STRETCH THEIR SUPPLIES OF FOOD AND WATER
tst2013.talkid1637_041 TO BE EATEN BY CANNIBALS TO BE BATTERED BY STORMS TO STARVE TO DEATH BEFORE REACHING LAND
tst2013.talkid1637_042 THESE WERE THE FEARS THAT DANCED IN THE IMAGINATIONS OF THESE POOR MEN AND AS IT TURNED OUT THE FEAR THEY CHOSE TO LISTEN TO WOULD GOVERN WHETHER THEY LIVED OR DIED
tst2013.talkid1637_043 NOW WE MIGHT JUST AS EASILY CALL THESE FEARS BY A DIFFERENT NAME
tst2013.talkid1637_044 WHAT IF INSTEAD OF CALLING THEM FEARS WE CALLED THEM STORIES
tst2013.talkid1637_045 BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY WHAT FEAR IS IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT
tst2013.talkid1637_046 IT'S A KIND OF UNINTENTIONAL STORYTELLING THAT WE ARE ALL BORN KNOWING HOW TO DO
tst2013.talkid1637_047 AND FEARS AND STORYTELLING HAVE THE SAME COMPONENTS
tst2013.talkid1637_048 THEY HAVE THE SAME ARCHITECTURE
tst2013.talkid1637_049 LIKE ALL STORIES FEARS HAVE CHARACTERS
tst2013.talkid1637_050 IN OUR FEARS THE CHARACTERS ARE US
tst2013.talkid1637_051 FEARS ALSO HAVE PLOTS THEY HAVE BEGINNINGS AND MIDDLES AND ENDS
tst2013.talkid1637_052 YOU BOARD THE PLANE THE PLANE TAKES OFF THE ENGINE FAILS
tst2013.talkid1637_053 OUR FEARS ALSO TEND TO CONTAIN IMAGERY THAT CAN BE EVERY BIT AS VIVID AS WHAT YOU MIGHT FIND IN THE PAGES OF A NOVEL
tst2013.talkid1637_054 PICTURE A CANNIBAL HUMAN TEETH SINKING INTO HUMAN SKIN HUMAN FLESH ROASTING OVER A FIRE
tst2013.talkid1637_055 FEARS ALSO HAVE SUSPENSE
tst2013.talkid1637_056 IF I'VE DONE MY JOB AS A STORYTELLER TODAY YOU SHOULD BE WONDERING WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MEN OF THE WHALESHIP ESSEX
tst2013.talkid1637_057 OUR FEARS PROVOKE IN US A VERY SIMILAR FORM OF SUSPENSE
tst2013.talkid1637_058 JUST LIKE ALL GREAT STORIES OUR FEARS FOCUS OUR ATTENTION ON A QUESTION THAT IS AS IMPORTANT IN LIFE AS IT IS IN LITERATURE WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT
tst2013.talkid1637_059 IN OTHER WORDS OUR FEARS MAKE US THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE
tst2013.talkid1637_060 AND HUMANS BY THE WAY ARE THE ONLY CREATURES CAPABLE OF THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE IN THIS WAY OF PROJECTING OURSELVES FORWARD IN TIME AND THIS MENTAL TIME TRAVEL IS JUST ONE MORE THING THAT FEARS HAVE IN COMMON WITH STORYTELLING
tst2013.talkid1637_061 AS A WRITER I CAN TELL YOU THAT A BIG PART OF WRITING FICTION IS LEARNING TO PREDICT HOW ONE EVENT IN A STORY WILL AFFECT ALL THE OTHER EVENTS AND FEAR WORKS IN THAT SAME WAY
tst2013.talkid1637_062 IN FEAR JUST LIKE IN FICTION ONE THING ALWAYS LEADS TO ANOTHER
tst2013.talkid1637_063 WHEN I WAS WRITING MY FIRST NOVEL THE AGE OF MIRACLES I SPENT MONTHS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE ROTATION OF THE EARTH SUDDENLY BEGAN TO SLOW DOWN
tst2013.talkid1637_064 WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO OUR DAYS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO OUR CROPS
tst2013.talkid1637_065 WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO OUR MINDS
tst2013.talkid1637_066 UH AND THEN IT WAS ONLY LATER THAT I REALIZED HOW VERY SIMILAR THESE QUESTIONS WERE TO THE ONES I USED TO ASK MYSELF AS A CHILD FRIGHTENED IN THE NIGHT
tst2013.talkid1637_067 IF AN EARTHQUAKE STRIKES TONIGHT I USED TO WORRY WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO OUR HOUSE WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO OUR TO MY FAMILY
tst2013.talkid1637_068 AND THE ANSWER TO THOSE QUESTIONS ALWAYS TOOK THE FORM OF A STORY
tst2013.talkid1637_069 SO IF WE THINK OF OUR FEARS AS MORE THAN JUST FEARS BUT AS STORIES WE SHOULD THINK OF OURSELVES AS THE AUTHORS OF THOSE STORIES
tst2013.talkid1637_070 BUT JUST AS IMPORTANTLY WE NEED TO THINK OF OURSELVES AS THE READERS OF OUR FEARS AND HOW WE CHOOSE TO READ OUR FEARS CAN HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT ON OUR LIVES
tst2013.talkid1637_071 NOW SOME OF US NATURALLY READ OUR FEARS MORE CLOSELY THAN OTHERS
tst2013.talkid1637_072 I READ ABOUT A STUDY RECENTLY OF SUCCESSFUL ENTREPRENEURS AND THE AUTHOR FOUND THAT THESE PEOPLE SHARED A HABIT THAT HE CALLED PRODUCTIVE PARANOIA WHICH MEANT THAT THESE PEOPLE INSTEAD OF DISMISSING THEIR FEARS THESE PEOPLE READ THEM CLOSELY THEY STUDIED THEM AND THEN THEY TRANSLATED THAT FEAR INTO PREPARATION AND ACTION
tst2013.talkid1637_073 SO THAT WAY IF THEIR WORST FEARS CAME TRUE THEIR BUSINESSES WERE READY
tst2013.talkid1637_074 AND SOMETIMES OF COURSE OUR WORST FEARS DO COME TRUE
tst2013.talkid1637_075 THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS SO EXTRAORDINARY ABOUT FEAR
tst2013.talkid1637_076 ONCE IN A WHILE OUR FEARS CAN PREDICT THE FUTURE
tst2013.talkid1637_077 BUT WE CAN'T POSSIBLY PREPARE FOR ALL OF THE FEARS THAT OUR IMAGINATIONS CONCOCT
tst2013.talkid1637_078 SO HOW CAN WE TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FEARS WORTH LISTENING TO AND ALL THE OTHERS
tst2013.talkid1637_079 I THINK THE END OF THE STORY OF THE WHALESHIP ESSEX OFFERS AN ILLUMINATING IF TRAGIC EXAMPLE
tst2013.talkid1637_080 AFTER MUCH DELIBERATION THE MEN FINALLY MADE A DECISION
tst2013.talkid1637_081 TERRIFIED OF CANNIBALS THEY DECIDED TO FORGO THE CLOSEST ISLANDS AND INSTEAD EMBARKED ON THE LONGER AND MUCH MORE DIFFICULT ROUTE TO SOUTH AMERICA
tst2013.talkid1637_082 AFTER MORE THAN TWO MONTHS AT SEA THE MEN RAN OUT OF FOOD AS THEY KNEW THEY MIGHT AND THEY WERE STILL QUITE FAR FROM LAND
tst2013.talkid1637_083 WHEN THE LAST OF THE SURVIVORS WERE FINALLY PICKED UP BY TWO PASSING SHIPS LESS THAN HALF OF THE MEN WERE LEFT ALIVE AND SOME OF THEM HAD RESORTED TO THEIR OWN FORM OF CANNIBALISM
tst2013.talkid1637_084 HERMAN MELVILLE WHO USED THIS STORY AS RESEARCH FOR MOBY DICK WROTE YEARS LATER AND FROM DRY LAND QUOTE ALL THE SUFFERINGS OF THESE MISERABLE MEN OF THE ESSEX MIGHT IN ALL HUMAN PROBABILITY HAVE BEEN AVOIDED HAD THEY IMMEDIATELY AFTER LEAVING THE WRECK STEERED STRAIGHT FOR TAHITI
tst2013.talkid1637_085 BUT AS MELVILLE PUT IT THEY DREADED CANNIBALS
tst2013.talkid1637_086 SO THE QUESTION IS WHY DID THESE MEN DREAD CANNIBALS SO MUCH MORE THAN THE EXTREME LIKELIHOOD OF STARVATION
tst2013.talkid1637_087 WHY WERE THEY SWAYED BY ONE STORY SO MUCH MORE THAN THE OTHER
tst2013.talkid1637_088 LOOKED AT FROM THIS ANGLE THEIRS BECOMES A STORY ABOUT READING
tst2013.talkid1637_089 THE NOVELIST VLADIMIR NABOKOV SAID THAT THE BEST READER HAS A COMBINATION OF TWO VERY DIFFERENT TEMPERAMENTS THE ARTISTIC AND THE SCIENTIFIC
tst2013.talkid1637_090 A GOOD READER HAS AN ARTIST'S PASSION A WILLINGNESS TO GET CAUGHT UP IN THE STORY BUT JUST AS IMPORTANTLY THE READER ALSO NEEDS THE COOLNESS OF JUDGMENT OF A SCIENTIST WHICH ACTS TO TEMPER AND COMPLICATE THE READER'S INTUITIVE REACTIONS TO THE STORY
tst2013.talkid1637_091 AS WE'VE SEEN THE MEN OF THE ESSEX HAD NO TROUBLE WITH THE ARTISTIC PART
tst2013.talkid1637_092 THEY DREAMED UP A VARIETY OF HORRIFYING SCENARIOS
tst2013.talkid1637_093 THE PROBLEM WAS THAT THEY LISTENED TO THE WRONG STORY
tst2013.talkid1637_094 OF ALL THE NARRATIVES THEIR FEARS WROTE THEY RESPONDED ONLY TO THE MOST LURID THE MOST VIVID THE ONE THAT WAS EASIEST FOR THEIR IMAGINATIONS TO PICTURE CANNIBALS
tst2013.talkid1637_095 BUT PERHAPS IF THEY'D BEEN ABLE TO READ THEIR FEARS MORE LIKE A SCIENTIST WITH MORE COOLNESS OF JUDGMENT THEY WOULD HAVE LISTENED INSTEAD TO THE LESS VIOLENT BUT THE MORE LIKELY TALE THE STORY OF STARVATION AND HEADED FOR TAHITI JUST AS MELVILLE'S SAD COMMENTARY SUGGESTS
tst2013.talkid1637_096 AND MAYBE IF WE ALL TRIED TO READ OUR FEARS WE TOO WOULD BE LESS OFTEN SWAYED BY THE MOST SALACIOUS AMONG THEM
tst2013.talkid1637_097 MAYBE THEN WE'D SPEND LESS TIME WORRYING ABOUT SERIAL KILLERS AND PLANE CRASHES AND MORE TIME CONCERNED WITH THE SUBTLER AND SLOWER DISASTERS WE FACE THE SILENT BUILDUP OF PLAQUE IN OUR ARTERIES THE GRADUAL CHANGES IN OUR CLIMATE
tst2013.talkid1637_098 JUST AS THE MOST NUANCED STORIES IN LITERATURE ARE OFTEN THE RICHEST SO TOO MIGHT OUR SUBTLEST FEARS BE THE TRUEST
tst2013.talkid1637_099 READ IN THE RIGHT WAY OUR FEARS ARE AN AMAZING GIFT OF THE IMAGINATION A KIND OF EVERYDAY CLAIRVOYANCE A WAY OF GLIMPSING WHAT MIGHT BE THE FUTURE WHEN THERE'S STILL TIME TO INFLUENCE HOW THAT FUTURE WILL PLAY OUT
tst2013.talkid1637_100 PROPERLY READ OUR FEARS CAN OFFER US SOMETHING AS PRECIOUS AS OUR FAVORITE WORKS OF LITERATURE A LITTLE WISDOM A BIT OF INSIGHT AND A VERSION OF THAT MOST ELUSIVE THING THE TRUTH
tst2013.talkid1637_101 THANK YOU
tst2013.talkid1640_000 WE LIVE IN AN INCREDIBLY BUSY WORLD
tst2013.talkid1640_001 THE PACE OF LIFE IS OFTEN FRANTIC OUR MINDS ARE ALWAYS BUSY AND WE'RE ALWAYS DOING SOMETHING
tst2013.talkid1640_002 SO WITH THAT IN MIND I'D LIKE YOU JUST TO TAKE A MOMENT TO THINK WHEN DID YOU LAST TAKE ANY TIME TO DO NOTHING
tst2013.talkid1640_003 JUST TEN MINUTES UNDISTURBED
tst2013.talkid1640_004 AND WHEN I SAY NOTHING I DO MEAN NOTHING
tst2013.talkid1640_005 SO THAT'S NO EMAILING TEXTING NO INTERNET NO TV NO CHATTING NO EATING NO READING NOT EVEN SITTING THERE REMINISCING ABOUT THE PAST OR PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE
tst2013.talkid1640_006 SIMPLY DOING NOTHING
tst2013.talkid1640_007 I SEE A LOT OF VERY BLANK FACES
tst2013.talkid1640_008 MY THINKING IS YOU PROBABLY HAVE TO GO A LONG WAY BACK
tst2013.talkid1640_009 AND THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY THING RIGHT
tst2013.talkid1640_010 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR MIND
tst2013.talkid1640_011 THE MIND OUR MOST VALUABLE AND PRECIOUS RESOURCE THROUGH WHICH WE EXPERIENCE EVERY SINGLE MOMENT OF OUR LIFE THE MIND THAT WE RELY UPON TO BE HAPPY CONTENT EMOTIONALLY STABLE AS INDIVIDUALS AND AT THE SAME TIME TO BE KIND AND THOUGHTFUL AND CONSIDERATE IN OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHERS
tst2013.talkid1640_012 THIS IS THE SAME MIND THAT WE DEPEND UPON TO BE FOCUSED CREATIVE SPONTANEOUS AND TO PERFORM AT OUR VERY BEST IN EVERYTHING THAT WE DO
tst2013.talkid1640_013 AND YET WE DON'T TAKE ANY TIME OUT TO LOOK AFTER IT
tst2013.talkid1640_014 IN FACT WE SPEND MORE TIME LOOKING AFTER OUR CARS OUR CLOTHES AND OUR HAIR THAN WE OKAY MAYBE NOT OUR HAIR BUT YOU SEE WHERE I'M GOING
tst2013.talkid1640_015 THE RESULT OF COURSE IS THAT WE GET STRESSED
tst2013.talkid1640_016 YOU KNOW THE MIND WHIZZES AWAY LIKE A WASHING MACHINE GOING ROUND AND ROUND LOTS OF DIFFICULT CONFUSING EMOTIONS AND WE DON'T REALLY KIND OF KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH THAT AND THE SAD FACT IS THAT WE ARE SO DISTRACTED THAT WE'RE NO LONGER PRESENT IN THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE
tst2013.talkid1640_017 WE MISS OUT ON THE THINGS THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO US AND THE CRAZY THING IS THAT EVERYBODY JUST ASSUMES WELL THAT'S THE WAY LIFE IS SO WE'VE JUST KIND OF GOT TO GET ON WITH IT
tst2013.talkid1640_018 THAT'S REALLY NOT HOW IT HAS TO BE
tst2013.talkid1640_019 SO I WAS ABOUT ELEVEN WHEN I WENT ALONG TO MY FIRST MEDITATION CLASS
tst2013.talkid1640_020 AND TRUST ME IT HAD ALL THE STEREOTYPES THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE THE SITTING CROSS LEGGED ON THE FLOOR THE INCENSE THE HERBAL TEA THE VEGETARIANS THE WHOLE DEAL BUT MY MOM WAS GOING AND I WAS INTRIGUED SO I WENT ALONG WITH HER
tst2013.talkid1640_021 I'D ALSO SEEN A FEW KUNG FU MOVIES AND SECRETLY I KIND OF THOUGHT I MIGHT BE ABLE TO LEARN HOW TO FLY BUT I WAS VERY YOUNG AT THE TIME
tst2013.talkid1640_022 NOW AS I WAS THERE I GUESS LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE I ASSUMED THAT IT WAS JUST AN ASPIRIN FOR THE MIND
tst2013.talkid1640_023 YOU GET STRESSED YOU DO SOME MEDITATION
tst2013.talkid1640_024 I HADN'T REALLY THOUGHT THAT IT COULD BE SORT OF PREVENTATIVE IN NATURE UNTIL I WAS ABOUT TWENTY WHEN A NUMBER OF THINGS HAPPENED IN MY LIFE IN QUITE QUICK SUCCESSION REALLY SERIOUS THINGS WHICH JUST FLIPPED MY LIFE UPSIDE DOWN AND ALL OF A SUDDEN I WAS INUNDATED WITH THOUGHTS INUNDATED WITH DIFFICULT EMOTIONS THAT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO COPE WITH
tst2013.talkid1640_025 EVERY TIME I SORT OF PUSHED ONE DOWN ANOTHER ONE WOULD JUST SORT OF POP BACK UP AGAIN
tst2013.talkid1640_026 IT WAS A REALLY VERY STRESSFUL TIME
tst2013.talkid1640_027 I GUESS WE ALL DEAL WITH STRESS IN DIFFERENT WAYS
tst2013.talkid1640_028 SOME PEOPLE WILL BURY THEMSELVES IN WORK GRATEFUL FOR THE THE DISTRACTION
tst2013.talkid1640_029 OTHERS WILL TURN TO THEIR FRIENDS THEIR FAMILY LOOKING FOR SUPPORT
tst2013.talkid1640_030 SOME PEOPLE HIT THE BOTTLE START TAKING MEDICATION
tst2013.talkid1640_031 MY OWN WAY OF DEALING WITH IT WAS TO BECOME A MONK
tst2013.talkid1640_032 SO I QUIT MY DEGREE I HEADED OFF TO THE HIMALAYAS I BECAME A MONK AND I STARTED STUDYING MEDITATION
tst2013.talkid1640_033 PEOPLE OFTEN ASK ME YOU KNOW WHAT I LEARNED FROM THAT TIME
tst2013.talkid1640_034 WELL OBVIOUSLY IT CHANGED THINGS
tst2013.talkid1640_035 YOU KNOW LET'S FACE IT BECOMING A CELIBATE MONK IS GOING TO CHANGE A NUMBER OF THINGS
tst2013.talkid1640_036 BUT IT WAS MORE THAN THAT
tst2013.talkid1640_037 YOU KNOW IT IT TAUGHT ME IT GAVE ME A GREATER APPRECIATION AN UNDERSTANDING FOR THE PRESENT MOMENT
tst2013.talkid1640_038 BY THAT I MEAN NOT BEING LOST IN THOUGHT NOT BEING DISTRACTED NOT BEING OVERWHELMED BY DIFFICULT EMOTIONS BUT INSTEAD LEARNING HOW TO BE IN THE HERE AND NOW HOW TO BE MINDFUL HOW TO BE PRESENT
tst2013.talkid1640_039 I THINK THE PRESENT MOMENT IS SO UNDERRATED
tst2013.talkid1640_040 IT SOUNDS SO ORDINARY AND YET WE SPEND SO LITTLE TIME IN THE PRESENT MOMENT THAT IT'S ANYTHING BUT ORDINARY
tst2013.talkid1640_041 THERE WAS A RESEARCH PAPER THAT CAME OUT OF HARVARD JUST RECENTLY THAT SAID ON AVERAGE OUR MINDS ARE LOST IN THOUGHT ALMOST FORTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THE TIME
tst2013.talkid1640_042 FORTY SEVEN PERCENT
tst2013.talkid1640_043 AT THE SAME TIME THIS SORT OF CONSTANT MIND WANDERING IS ALSO A DIRECT CAUSE OF UNHAPPINESS
tst2013.talkid1640_044 NOW WE'RE NOT HERE FOR THAT LONG ANYWAY BUT TO SPEND ALMOST HALF OF OUR LIFE LOST IN THOUGHT AND POTENTIALLY QUITE UNHAPPY DUNNO IT JUST KIND OF SEEMS TRAGIC ACTUALLY ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT WHEN THERE'S A A POSITIVE PRACTICAL ACHIEVABLE SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN TECHNIQUE WHICH ALLOWS OUR MIND TO BE MORE HEALTHY TO BE MORE MINDFUL AND LESS DISTRACTED
tst2013.talkid1640_045 AND THE BEAUTY OF IT IS THAT EVEN THOUGH IT KIND OF NEED ONLY TAKE ABOUT TEN MINUTES A DAY IT IMPACTS OUR ENTIRE LIFE
tst2013.talkid1640_046 BUT WE NEED TO KNOW HOW TO DO IT
tst2013.talkid1640_047 WE NEED AN EXERCISE WE NEED A FRAMEWORK TO LEARN HOW TO BE MORE MINDFUL
tst2013.talkid1640_048 THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT MEDITATION IS
tst2013.talkid1640_049 IT'S FAMILIARIZING OURSELVES WITH THE PRESENT MOMENT
tst2013.talkid1640_050 BUT WE ALSO NEED TO KNOW HOW TO APPROACH IT IN THE RIGHT WAY TO GET THE BEST FROM IT
tst2013.talkid1640_051 AND THAT'S WHAT THESE ARE FOR IN CASE YOU'VE BEEN WONDERING BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE ASSUME THAT MEDITATION IS ALL ABOUT SORT OF STOPPING THOUGHTS GETTING RID OF EMOTIONS SOMEHOW CONTROLLING THE MIND BUT ACTUALLY IT'S QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THAT
tst2013.talkid1640_052 IT'S MORE ABOUT SORT OF STEPPING BACK SORT OF SEEING THE THOUGHT CLEARLY WITNESSING IT COMING AND GOING EMOTIONS COMING AND GOING WITHOUT JUDGMENT BUT WITH A RELAXED FOCUSED MIND
tst2013.talkid1640_053 SO FOR EXAMPLE RIGHT NOW IF I FOCUS TOO MUCH ON THE BALLS THEN THERE'S NO WAY THAT I CAN RELAX AND TALK TO YOU AT THE SAME TIME
tst2013.talkid1640_054 EQUALLY IF I RELAX TOO MUCH TALKING TO YOU THEN THERE'S NO WAY I CAN FOCUS ON THE BALLS I'M GOING TO DROP THEM
tst2013.talkid1640_055 NOW IN LIFE AND IN MEDITATION THERE'LL BE TIMES WHEN THE FOCUS BECOMES A LITTLE BIT TOO INTENSE AND LIFE STARTS TO FEEL A BIT LIKE THIS
tst2013.talkid1640_056 IT'S A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WAY TO LIVE LIFE WHEN YOU GET THIS TIGHT AND STRESSED
tst2013.talkid1640_057 AT OTHER TIMES WE MIGHT TAKE OUR FOOT OFF THE GAS A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH AND THINGS JUST BECOME A SORT OF LITTLE BIT LIKE THIS
tst2013.talkid1640_058 OF COURSE IN MEDITATION WE'RE GOING TO END UP FALLING ASLEEP
tst2013.talkid1640_059 SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR A BALANCE A FOCUSED RELAXATION WHERE WE CAN ALLOW THOUGHTS TO COME AND GO WITHOUT ALL THE USUAL INVOLVEMENT
tst2013.talkid1640_060 NOW WHAT USUALLY HAPPENS WHEN WE'RE LEARNING TO BE MINDFUL IS THAT WE GET DISTRACTED BY A THOUGHT
tst2013.talkid1640_061 LET'S SAY THIS IS AN ANXIOUS THOUGHT
tst2013.talkid1640_062 SO EVERYTHING'S GOING FINE AND THEN WE SEE THE ANXIOUS THOUGHT AND IT'S LIKE OH DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS WORRIED ABOUT THAT
tst2013.talkid1640_063 YOU GO BACK TO IT REPEAT IT OH I AM WORRIED
tst2013.talkid1640_064 OH I REALLY AM WORRIED WOW THERE'S SO MUCH ANXIETY
tst2013.talkid1640_065 AND BEFORE WE KNOW IT RIGHT WE'RE ANXIOUS ABOUT FEELING ANXIOUS
tst2013.talkid1640_066 YOU KNOW THIS IS CRAZY WE DO THIS ALL THE TIME EVEN ON AN EVERYDAY KIND OF LEVEL
tst2013.talkid1640_067 IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE LAST TIME I DUNNO YOU HAD A WOBBLY TOOTH
tst2013.talkid1640_068 YOU KNOW IT'S WOBBLY AND YOU KNOW THAT IT HURTS
tst2013.talkid1640_069 BUT WHAT DO YOU DO EVERY TWENTY THIRTY SECONDS
tst2013.talkid1640_070 IT DOES HURT AND WE REINFORCE THE STORYLINE RIGHT
tst2013.talkid1640_071 AND WE JUST KEEP TELLING OURSELVES AND WE DO IT ALL THE TIME AND IT'S ONLY IN LEARNING TO WATCH THE MIND IN THIS WAY THAT WE CAN START TO LET GO OF THOSE STORYLINES AND PATTERNS OF MIND
tst2013.talkid1640_072 BUT WHEN YOU SIT DOWN AND YOU WATCH THE MIND IN THIS WAY YOU MIGHT SEE MANY DIFFERENT PATTERNS
tst2013.talkid1640_073 YOU MIGHT FIND A MIND THAT'S REALLY SORT OF RESTLESS AND THE WHOLE TIME
tst2013.talkid1640_074 DON'T BE SURPRISED IF YOU FEEL A BIT AGITATED IN YOUR BODY WHEN YOU SIT DOWN TO DO NOTHING AND YOUR MIND FEELS LIKE THAT
tst2013.talkid1640_075 YOU MIGHT FIND A MIND THAT'S VERY SORT OF DULL AND BORING AND IT'S JUST ALMOST MECHANICAL IT JUST SEEMS IT'S AS IF YOU'RE GETTING UP GOING TO WORK EAT SLEEP GET UP WORK
tst2013.talkid1640_076 OR IT MIGHT JUST BE THAT ONE LITTLE NAGGING THOUGHT THAT JUST GOES ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND YOUR MIND
tst2013.talkid1640_077 WELL WHATEVER IT IS MEDITATION OFFERS THE OPPORTUNITY THE POTENTIAL TO STEP BACK AND TO GET A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE TO SEE THAT THINGS AREN'T ALWAYS AS THEY APPEAR
tst2013.talkid1640_078 YOU KNOW WE CAN'T CHANGE EVERY LITTLE THING THAT HAPPENS TO US IN LIFE BUT WE CAN CHANGE THE WAY THAT WE EXPERIENCE IT
tst2013.talkid1640_079 THAT'S THE POTENTIAL OF MEDITATION OF MINDFULNESS
tst2013.talkid1640_080 YOU DON'T HAVE TO BURN ANY INCENSE AND YOU DEFINITELY DON'T HAVE TO SIT ON THE FLOOR
tst2013.talkid1640_081 ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS TO TAKE TEN MINUTES OUT A DAY TO STEP BACK TO FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH THE PRESENT MOMENT SO THAT YOU GET TO EXPERIENCE A GREATER SENSE OF FOCUS CALM AND CLARITY IN YOUR LIFE
tst2013.talkid1640_082 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
tst2013.talkid1646_000 I WAS SITTING WITH MY GIRLS AND JOY SAID DANG I WISH HE'D GET OFF MY BACK
tst2013.talkid1646_001 MY DADDY HE CALLS ME ALL THE TIME
tst2013.talkid1646_002 LUCKY FOR YOU HE CALLS AT ALL SAID JASMINE
tst2013.talkid1646_003 I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM MY DAD IN YEARS
tst2013.talkid1646_004 AT THIS MOMENT I KNEW THE GIRLS NEEDED A WAY TO CONNECT WITH THEIR FATHERS
tst2013.talkid1646_005 AT CAMP DIVA MY NON PROFIT ORGANIZATION WE HAVE THESE TYPES OF CONVERSATIONS ALL THE TIME AS A WAY TO HELP GIRLS OF AFRICAN DESCENT PREPARE FOR THEIR PASSAGE INTO WOMANHOOD
tst2013.talkid1646_006 THESE GIRLS JUST NEEDED A WAY TO INVITE THEIR FATHERS INTO THEIR LIVES ON THEIR OWN TERMS
tst2013.talkid1646_007 SO I ASKED THE GIRLS HOW CAN WE HELP OTHER GIRLS DEVELOP HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEIR FATHERS
tst2013.talkid1646_008 LET'S HAVE A DANCE ONE GIRL SHOUTED AND ALL THE GIRLS QUICKLY BACKED HER UP
tst2013.talkid1646_009 THEY STARTED DREAMING ABOUT THE DECORATIONS INVITATIONS THE DRESSES THEY WERE GOING TO WEAR AND WHAT THEIR FATHERS COULD AND COULD NOT WEAR
tst2013.talkid1646_010 IT WAS OFF AND RUNNING BEFORE I COULD EVEN BLINK MY EYES BUT EVEN IF I COULD HAVE SLOWED DOWN THOSE GIRLS I WOULDN'T HAVE BECAUSE ONE THING THAT I HAVE LEARNED FROM OVER A DECADE OF WORKING WITH GIRLS IS THAT THEY ALREADY KNOW WHAT THEY NEED
tst2013.talkid1646_011 THE WISDOM LIVES INSIDE OF THEM
tst2013.talkid1646_012 AS LONG AS THEY HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE MENTORSHIP AND RESOURCES THEY CAN BUILD WHAT THEY NEED NOT ONLY TO SURVIVE BUT TO TO THRIVE
tst2013.talkid1646_013 SO WE HAD A DANCE AND GIRLS AND THEIR FATHERS CAME IN MULTITUDE
tst2013.talkid1646_014 THEY WERE DRESSED TO THE NINE
tst2013.talkid1646_015 THEY ACTED SWEET
tst2013.talkid1646_016 THEY ACTED SILLY
tst2013.talkid1646_017 THEY REALLY ENJOYED EACH OTHER'S COMPANY
tst2013.talkid1646_018 IT WAS A HUGE SUCCESS
tst2013.talkid1646_019 AND THE GIRLS DECIDED TO MAKE IT AN ANNUAL EVENT
tst2013.talkid1646_020 SO AS THE SEASONS CHANGED AND IT WAS TIME TO PLAN THE DANCE AGAIN ONE GIRL NAMED BRIANNA SPOKE UP AND SHE SAID MY DAD CAN'T COME TO THE DANCE AND THIS WHOLE THING IS MAKING ME SAD
tst2013.talkid1646_021 WHY NOT THE GIRLS ASKED
tst2013.talkid1646_022 BECAUSE HE'S IN JAIL SHE BRAVELY ADMITTED
tst2013.talkid1646_023 WELL CAN HE JUST GET OUT FOR A DAY ONE OF THE GIRLS ASKED
tst2013.talkid1646_024 AND COME IN SHACKLES
tst2013.talkid1646_025 THAT'S WORSE THAN NOT HAVING HIM HERE AT ALL
tst2013.talkid1646_026 AT THIS MOMENT I SAW AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE GIRLS TO RISE TO THE OCCASION AND TO BECOME THEIR OWN HEROES
tst2013.talkid1646_027 SO I ASKED WHAT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD DO ABOUT THIS
tst2013.talkid1646_028 WE WANT EVERY GIRL TO EXPERIENCE THE DANCE RIGHT
tst2013.talkid1646_029 SO THE GIRLS THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT AND ONE GIRL SUGGESTED WHY DON'T WE JUST TAKE THE DANCE IN THE JAIL
tst2013.talkid1646_030 MOST OF THE GIRLS DOUBTED THE POSSIBILITY OF THAT AND SAID ARE YOU CRAZY
tst2013.talkid1646_031 WHO IS GOING TO ALLOW A BUNCH OF LITTLE GIRLS DRESSED UP TO COME INSIDE A JAIL AND DANCE WITH THEIR DADDIES IN SPONGEBOB SUITS
tst2013.talkid1646_032 BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY CALLED THEM
tst2013.talkid1646_033 I SAID GIRLS WELL WELL YOU NEVER KNOW UNLESS YOU ASK
tst2013.talkid1646_034 SO A LETTER WAS WRITTEN TO THE RICHMOND CITY SHERIFF SIGNED COLLECTIVELY BY EACH GIRL AND I WOULD HAVE TO SAY HE IS A VERY SPECIAL SHERIFF
tst2013.talkid1646_035 HE CONTACTED ME IMMEDIATELY AND SAID WHENEVER THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING FAMILIES INSIDE HIS DOORS ARE ALWAYS OPEN
tst2013.talkid1646_036 BECAUSE ONE THING HE DID KNOW THAT WHEN FATHERS ARE CONNECTED TO THEIR CHILDREN IT IS LESS LIKELY THAT THEY WILL RETURN
tst2013.talkid1646_037 SO SIXTEEN INMATES AND EIGHTEEN GIRLS WERE INVITED
tst2013.talkid1646_038 THE GIRLS WERE DRESSED IN THEIR SUNDAY BEST AND THE FATHERS TRADED IN THEIR YELLOW AND BLUE JUMPSUITS FOR SHIRTS AND TIES
tst2013.talkid1646_039 THEY HUGGED
tst2013.talkid1646_040 THEY SHARED A FULL CATERED MEAL OF CHICKEN AND FISH
tst2013.talkid1646_041 THEY LAUGHED TOGETHER
tst2013.talkid1646_042 IT WAS BEAUTIFUL
tst2013.talkid1646_043 THE FATHERS AND DAUGHTERS EVEN EXPERIENCED AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A PHYSICAL CONNECTION SOMETHING THAT A LOT OF THEM DIDN'T EVEN HAVE FOR A WHILE
tst2013.talkid1646_044 FATHERS WERE IN A SPACE WHERE THEY WERE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR DAUGHTERS PLAY AND PULL OUT HER CHAIR AND EXTEND HIS HAND FOR A DANCE
tst2013.talkid1646_045 EVEN THE GUARDS CRIED
tst2013.talkid1646_046 BUT AFTER THE DANCE WE ALL REALIZED THAT DAD STILL WOULD BE IN JAIL
tst2013.talkid1646_047 SO WE NEEDED TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT THEY COULD TAKE WITH THEM
tst2013.talkid1646_048 SO WE BROUGHT IN FLIP CAMS AND WE HAD THEM LOOK AT THE FLIP CAMS AND JUST INTERVIEW EACH OTHER THEIR MESSAGES THEIR THOUGHTS
tst2013.talkid1646_049 THIS WAS GOING TO BE USED AS A TOUCHSTONE SO WHEN THEY STARTED TO MISS EACH OTHER AND FEEL DISCONNECTED THEY COULD RECONNECT THROUGH THIS IMAGE
tst2013.talkid1646_050 I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT ONE GIRL LOOKED IN HER FATHER'S EYES WITH THAT CAMERA AND SAID DADDY WHEN YOU LOOK AT ME WHAT DO YOU SEE
tst2013.talkid1646_051 BECAUSE OUR DADDIES ARE OUR MIRRORS THAT WE REFLECT BACK ON WHEN WE DECIDE ABOUT WHAT TYPE OF MAN WE DESERVE AND HOW THEY SEE US FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES
tst2013.talkid1646_052 I KNOW THAT VERY WELL BECAUSE I WAS ONE OF THE LUCKY GIRLS
tst2013.talkid1646_053 I HAVE HAD MY FATHER IN MY LIFE ALWAYS
tst2013.talkid1646_054 HE'S EVEN HERE TODAY
tst2013.talkid1646_055 AND THAT IS WHY IT IS EXTREMELY SPECIAL FOR ME TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE GIRLS ARE CONNECTED TO THEIR FATHERS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE SEPARATED BECAUSE OF BARBED WIRES AND METAL DOORS
tst2013.talkid1646_056 WE HAVE JUST CREATED A FORM FOR GIRLS WHO HAVE HEAVY QUESTIONS ON THEIR HEART TO BE IN A POSITION TO ASK THEIR FATHERS THOSE QUESTIONS AND GIVEN THE FATHERS THE FREEDOM TO ANSWER
tst2013.talkid1646_057 BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE FATHERS ARE EVEN LEAVING WITH THIS ONE THOUGHT WHAT TYPE OF WOMAN AM I PREPARING TO PUT IN THE WORLD
tst2013.talkid1646_058 BECAUSE A FATHER IS LOCKED IN DOES NOT MEAN HE SHOULD BE LOCKED OUT OF HIS DAUGHTER'S LIFE
tst2013.talkid1647_000 HI MY NAME IS CAMERON RUSSELL UM AND FOR THE LAST UH LITTLE WHILE I'VE BEEN A MODEL
tst2013.talkid1647_001 UM ACTUALLY FOR TEN YEARS
tst2013.talkid1647_002 UM AND I FEEL LIKE THERE'S AN UNCOMFORTABLE TENSION IN THE ROOM RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I SHOULD NOT HAVE WORN THIS DRESS
tst2013.talkid1647_003 SO LUCKILY I BROUGHT AN OUTFIT CHANGE
tst2013.talkid1647_004 THIS IS THE FIRST OUTFIT CHANGE ON THE TED STAGE SO YOU GUYS ARE PRETTY LUCKY TO WITNESS IT I THINK
tst2013.talkid1647_005 IF SOME OF THE WOMEN WERE REALLY HORRIFIED WHEN I CAME OUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME NOW BUT I'LL FIND OUT LATER ON TWITTER
tst2013.talkid1647_006 I'D ALSO NOTE THAT I'M QUITE PRIVILEGED TO BE ABLE TO TRANSFORM WHAT YOU THINK OF ME UM IN A VERY BRIEF TEN SECONDS
tst2013.talkid1647_007 NOT EVERYBODY GETS TO DO THAT
tst2013.talkid1647_008 THESE HEELS ARE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE SO GOOD THING I WASN'T GOING TO WEAR THEM
tst2013.talkid1647_009 THE WORST PART IS PUTTING THIS SWEATER OVER MY HEAD BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN YOU'LL ALL LAUGH AT ME SO DON'T DO ANYTHING WHILE IT'S OVER MY HEAD
tst2013.talkid1647_010 ALL RIGHT
tst2013.talkid1647_011 SO WHY DID I DO THAT
tst2013.talkid1647_012 THAT WAS AWKWARD
tst2013.talkid1647_013 WELL HOPEFULLY NOT AS AWKWARD AS THAT PICTURE
tst2013.talkid1647_014 IMAGE IS POWERFUL BUT ALSO IMAGE IS SUPERFICIAL
tst2013.talkid1647_015 I JUST TOTALLY TRANSFORMED WHAT YOU THOUGHT OF ME IN SIX SECONDS
tst2013.talkid1647_016 AND IN IN THIS PICTURE I HAD ACTUALLY NEVER HAD A BOYFRIEND IN REAL LIFE
tst2013.talkid1647_017 I WAS TOTALLY UNCOMFORTABLE AND THE PHOTOGRAPHER WAS TELLING ME TO ARCH MY BACK AND PUT MY HAND IN THAT GUY'S HAIR
tst2013.talkid1647_018 AND OF COURSE BARRING SURGERY UM OR THE FAKE TAN THAT I GOT TWO DAYS AGO FOR WORK UM THERE'S VERY LITTLE THAT WE CAN DO TO TRANSFORM HOW WE LOOK AND HOW WE LOOK THOUGH IT IS SUPERFICIAL AND IMMUTABLE HAS A HUGE IMPACT ON OUR LIVES
tst2013.talkid1647_019 SO TODAY FOR ME BEING FEARLESS MEANS BEING HONEST
tst2013.talkid1647_020 AND I AM ON THIS STAGE BECAUSE I AM A MODEL
tst2013.talkid1647_021 I AM ON THIS STAGE BECAUSE I AM A PRETTY WHITE WOMAN AND IN MY INDUSTRY WE CALL THAT A SEXY GIRL
tst2013.talkid1647_022 AND I'M GOING TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS THAT PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME BUT WITH AN HONEST TWIST
tst2013.talkid1647_023 SO THE FIRST QUESTION IS HOW DO YOU BECOME A MODEL
tst2013.talkid1647_024 AND I ALWAYS JUST SAY OH I WAS SCOUTED BUT THAT MEANS NOTHING
tst2013.talkid1647_025 THE REAL WAY THAT I BECAME A MODEL IS I WON A GENETIC LOTTERY AND I AM THE RECIPIENT OF A LEGACY AND MAYBE YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT IS A LEGACY
tst2013.talkid1647_026 WELL FOR THE PAST FEW CENTURIES WE HAVE DEFINED BEAUTY NOT JUST AS HEALTH AND YOUTH AND SYMMETRY THAT WE'RE BIOLOGICALLY PROGRAMMED TO ADMIRE BUT ALSO AS TALL SLENDER FIGURES AND FEMININITY AND WHITE SKIN
tst2013.talkid1647_027 AND THIS IS A LEGACY THAT WAS BUILT FOR ME AND IT'S A LEGACY THAT I'VE BEEN CASHING OUT ON
tst2013.talkid1647_028 AND I KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE WHO ARE SKEPTICAL AT THIS POINT AND MAYBE THERE ARE SOME FASHIONISTAS WHO ARE LIKE WAIT NAOMI TYRA JOAN SMALLS LIU WEN
tst2013.talkid1647_029 AND FIRST I COMMEND YOU ON YOUR MODEL KNOWLEDGE VERY IMPRESSIVE
tst2013.talkid1647_030 BUT UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE TO INFORM YOU THAT IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN A VERY INSPIRED NYU PHD STUDENT COUNTED ALL THE MODELS ON THE RUNWAY EVERY SINGLE ONE THAT WAS HIRED AND OF THE SIX HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN MODELS THAT WERE HIRED ONLY TWENTY SEVEN OR LESS THAN FOUR PERCENT WERE NON WHITE
tst2013.talkid1647_031 THE NEXT QUESTION PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME IS CAN I BE A MODEL WHEN I GROW UP
tst2013.talkid1647_032 AND THE FIRST ANSWER IS I DON'T KNOW THEY DON'T PUT ME IN CHARGE OF THAT
tst2013.talkid1647_033 BUT THE SECOND ANSWER AND WHAT I REALLY WANT TO SAY TO THESE LITTLE GIRLS IS WHY
tst2013.talkid1647_034 YOU KNOW YOU CAN BE ANYTHING
tst2013.talkid1647_035 YOU COULD BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OR THE INVENTOR OF THE NEXT INTERNET OR A NINJA CARDIO THORACIC SURGEON POET WHICH WOULD BE AWESOME BECAUSE YOU'D BE THE FIRST ONE
tst2013.talkid1647_036 IF AFTER THIS AMAZING LIST THEY STILL ARE LIKE NO NO CAMERON I WANT TO BE A MODEL WELL THEN I SAY BE MY BOSS
tst2013.talkid1647_037 BECAUSE I'M NOT IN CHARGE OF ANYTHING AND YOU COULD BE THE EDITOR IN CHIEF OF AMERICAN VOGUE OR THE CEO OF H AND M OR THE NEXT STEVEN MEISEL
tst2013.talkid1647_038 SAYING THAT YOU WANT TO BE A MODEL WHEN YOU GROW UP IS AKIN TO SAYING THAT YOU WANT TO WIN THE POWERBALL WHEN YOU GROW UP
tst2013.talkid1647_039 IT'S YOU KNOW OUT OF YOUR CONTROL AND IT'S AWESOME AND IT'S NOT A CAREER PATH
tst2013.talkid1647_040 I WILL DEMONSTRATE FOR YOU NOW TEN YEARS OF ACCUMULATED MODEL KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE UNLIKE CARDIO THORACIC SURGEONS IT CAN JUST BE DISTILLED RIGHT INTO RIGHT NOW
tst2013.talkid1647_041 SO IF THE PHOTOGRAPHER IS RIGHT THERE AND THE LIGHT IS RIGHT THERE LIKE A NICE HMI AND THE CLIENT SAYS CAMERON WE WANT A WALKING SHOT WELL THEN THIS LEG GOES FIRST NICE AND LONG THIS ARM GOES BACK THIS ARM GOES FORWARD THE HEAD IS AT THREE QUARTERS AND YOU JUST GO BACK AND FORTH JUST DO THAT AND THEN YOU LOOK BACK AT YOUR IMAGINARY FRIENDS THREE HUNDRED FOUR HUNDRED FIVE HUNDRED TIMES
tst2013.talkid1647_042 IT WILL LOOK SOMETHING LIKE THIS
tst2013.talkid1647_043 HOPEFULLY LESS AWKWARD THAN THAT ONE IN THE MIDDLE
tst2013.talkid1647_044 THAT WAS I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THERE
tst2013.talkid1647_045 UNFORTUNATELY AFTER YOU'VE GONE TO SCHOOL AND YOU HAVE A RÃ©SUMÃ© AND YOU'VE DONE A FEW JOBS YOU CAN'T SAY ANYTHING ANYMORE SO IF YOU SAY YOU WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BUT YOUR RÃ©SUMÃ© READS UNDERWEAR MODEL TEN YEARS PEOPLE GIVE YOU A FUNNY LOOK
tst2013.talkid1647_046 THE NEXT QUESTION PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME IS DO THEY RETOUCH ALL THE PHOTOS
tst2013.talkid1647_047 AND YEAH THEY PRETTY MUCH RETOUCH ALL THE PHOTOS BUT THAT IS ONLY A SMALL COMPONENT OF WHAT'S HAPPENING
tst2013.talkid1647_048 THIS PICTURE IS THE VERY FIRST PICTURE THAT I EVER TOOK AND IT'S ALSO THE VERY FIRST TIME THAT I HAD WORN A BIKINI AND I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE MY PERIOD YET
tst2013.talkid1647_049 I KNOW WE'RE GETTING PERSONAL BUT I WAS A YOUNG GIRL
tst2013.talkid1647_050 THIS IS WHAT I LOOKED LIKE WITH MY GRANDMA JUST A FEW MONTHS EARLIER
tst2013.talkid1647_051 HERE'S ME ON THE SAME DAY AS THIS SHOOT
tst2013.talkid1647_052 MY FRIEND GOT TO COME WITH ME
tst2013.talkid1647_053 HERE'S ME AT A SLUMBER PARTY A FEW DAYS BEFORE I SHOT FRENCH VOGUE
tst2013.talkid1647_054 HERE'S ME ON THE SOCCER TEAM AND IN V MAGAZINE
tst2013.talkid1647_055 AND HERE'S ME TODAY
tst2013.talkid1647_056 AND I HOPE WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS THAT THESE PICTURES ARE NOT PICTURES OF ME
tst2013.talkid1647_057 THEY ARE CONSTRUCTIONS AND THEY ARE CONSTRUCTIONS BY A GROUP OF PROFESSIONALS BY HAIRSTYLISTS AND MAKEUP ARTISTS AND PHOTOGRAPHERS AND STYLISTS AND ALL OF THEIR ASSISTANTS AND PRE PRODUCTION AND POST PRODUCTION AND THEY BUILD THIS THAT'S NOT ME
tst2013.talkid1647_058 OKAY SO THE NEXT QUESTION PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME IS DO YOU GET FREE STUFF
tst2013.talkid1647_059 I DO HAVE TOO MANY EIGHT INCH HEELS WHICH I NEVER GET TO WEAR EXCEPT FOR EARLIER BUT THE FREE STUFF THAT I GET IS THE FREE STUFF THAT I GET IN REAL LIFE AND THAT'S WHAT WE DON'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT
tst2013.talkid1647_060 I GREW UP IN CAMBRIDGE AND ONE TIME I WENT INTO A STORE AND I FORGOT MY MONEY AND THEY GAVE ME THE DRESS FOR FREE
tst2013.talkid1647_061 WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER I WAS DRIVING WITH MY FRIEND WHO WAS AN AWFUL DRIVER AND SHE RAN A RED AND OF COURSE WE GOT PULLED OVER AND ALL IT TOOK WAS A SORRY OFFICER AND WE WERE ON OUR WAY
tst2013.talkid1647_062 AND I GOT THESE FREE THINGS BECAUSE OF HOW I LOOK NOT WHO I AM AND THERE ARE PEOPLE PAYING A COST FOR HOW THEY LOOK AND NOT WHO THEY ARE
tst2013.talkid1647_063 I LIVE IN NEW YORK AND LAST YEAR OF THE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND TEENAGERS THAT WERE STOPPED AND FRISKED EIGHTY SIX PERCENT OF THEM WERE BLACK AND LATINO AND MOST OF THEM WERE YOUNG MEN
tst2013.talkid1647_064 AND THERE ARE ONLY A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND YOUNG BLACK AND LATINO MEN IN NEW YORK SO FOR THEM IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF WILL I GET STOPPED
tst2013.talkid1647_065 BUT HOW MANY TIMES WILL I GET STOPPED WHEN WILL I GET STOPPED
tst2013.talkid1647_066 WHEN I WAS RESEARCHING THIS TALK I FOUND OUT THAT OF THE THIRTEEN YEAR OLD GIRLS IN THE UNITED STATES FIFTY THREE PERCENT DON'T LIKE THEIR BODIES AND THAT NUMBER GOES TO SEVENTY EIGHT PERCENT BY THE TIME THAT THEY'RE SEVENTEEN
tst2013.talkid1647_067 SO THE LAST QUESTION PEOPLE ASK ME IS YOU KNOW WHAT IS IT LIKE TO BE A MODEL
tst2013.talkid1647_068 AND I THINK THE ANSWER THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR IS IF YOU ARE A LITTLE BIT SKINNIER AND YOU HAVE SHINIER HAIR YOU WILL BE SO HAPPY AND FABULOUS
tst2013.talkid1647_069 AND WHEN WE'RE BACKSTAGE WE GIVE AN ANSWER THAT MAYBE MAKES IT SEEM LIKE THAT
tst2013.talkid1647_070 WE SAY IT'S REALLY AMAZING TO TRAVEL AND IT'S AMAZING TO GET TO WORK WITH CREATIVE INSPIRED PASSIONATE PEOPLE
tst2013.talkid1647_071 AND THOSE THINGS ARE TRUE BUT THEY'RE ONLY ONE HALF OF THE STORY BECAUSE THE THING THAT WE NEVER SAY ON CAMERA THAT I HAVE NEVER SAID ON CAMERA IS I AM INSECURE
tst2013.talkid1647_072 AND I'M INSECURE BECAUSE I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT I LOOK LIKE EVERY DAY
tst2013.talkid1647_073 AND IF YOU EVER ARE WONDERING YOU KNOW IF I HAVE THINNER THIGHS AND SHINIER HAIR WILL I BE HAPPIER
tst2013.talkid1647_074 UM YOU JUST NEED TO MEET A GROUP OF MODELS BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE THINNEST THIGHS AND THE SHINIEST HAIR AND THE COOLEST CLOTHES AND THEY'RE THE MOST PHYSICALLY INSECURE WOMEN PROBABLY ON THE PLANET
tst2013.talkid1647_075 SO WHEN I WAS WRITING THIS TALK I FOUND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO STRIKE AN HONEST BALANCE BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND I FELT VERY UNCOMFORTABLE TO COME OUT HERE AND SAY LOOK I'VE RECEIVED ALL THESE BENEFITS FROM A DECK STACKED IN MY FAVOR AND IT ALSO FELT REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE TO FOLLOW THAT UP WITH AND IT DOESN'T ALWAYS MAKE ME HAPPY
tst2013.talkid1647_076 BUT MOSTLY IT WAS DIFFICULT TO UNPACK A LEGACY OF GENDER AND RACIAL OPPRESSION WHEN I AM ONE OF THE BIGGEST BENEFICIARIES
tst2013.talkid1647_077 BUT I'M ALSO HAPPY AND HONORED TO BE UP HERE AND I THINK THAT IT'S GREAT THAT I GOT TO COME BEFORE TEN OR TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS HAD PASSED AND I'D HAD MORE AGENCY IN MY CAREER BECAUSE MAYBE THEN I WOULDN'T TELL THE STORY OF HOW I GOT MY FIRST JOB OR MAYBE I WOULDN'T TELL THE STORY OF HOW I PAID FOR COLLEGE WHICH SEEMS SO IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW
tst2013.talkid1647_078 IF THERE'S A TAKEAWAY TO THIS TALK I HOPE IT'S THAT WE ALL FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE ACKNOWLEDGING THE POWER OF IMAGE IN OUR PERCEIVED SUCCESSES AND OUR PERCEIVED FAILURES
tst2013.talkid1647_079 THANK YOU
tst2013.talkid1649_000 WHAT I WANT TO DO THIS AFTERNOON IS SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT'S SCHEDULED
tst2013.talkid1649_001 FOREIGN POLICY YOU CAN FIGURE THAT OUT BY WATCHING I DON'T KNOW RACHEL MADDOW OR SOMEBODY BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE AND STRUCTURE YOUNG PEOPLE AND STRUCTURE
tst2013.talkid1649_002 THIS WAS LAST WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AT A SCHOOL IN BROOKLYN NEW YORK AT CRISTO REY HIGH SCHOOL RUN BY THE JESUITS
tst2013.talkid1649_003 AND I WAS TALKING TO THIS GROUP OF STUDENTS AND TAKE A LOOK AT THEM
tst2013.talkid1649_004 THEY WERE AROUND ME IN THREE DIRECTIONS
tst2013.talkid1649_005 YOU'LL NOTICED THAT ALMOST ALL OF THEM ARE MINORITY
tst2013.talkid1649_006 YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THE BUILDING IS RATHER AUSTERE
tst2013.talkid1649_007 IT'S AN OLD NEW YORK SCHOOL BUILDING NOTHING FANCY
tst2013.talkid1649_008 THEY STILL HAVE OLD BLACKBOARDS AND WHATNOT
tst2013.talkid1649_009 AND THERE ARE ABOUT THREE HUNDRED KIDS IN THIS SCHOOL AND THE SCHOOL'S BEEN GOING NOW FOR FOUR YEARS AND THEY'RE ABOUT TO GRADUATE THEIR FIRST CLASS
tst2013.talkid1649_010 TWENTY TWO PEOPLE ARE GRADUATING AND ALL TWENTY TWO ARE GOING TO COLLEGE
tst2013.talkid1649_011 THEY ALL COME FROM HOMES WHERE THERE IS FOR THE MOST PART JUST ONE PERSON IN THE HOME USUALLY THE MOTHER OR THE GRANDMOTHER AND THAT'S IT AND THEY COME HERE FOR THEIR EDUCATION AND FOR THEIR STRUCTURE
tst2013.talkid1649_012 NOW I HAD THIS PICTURE TAKEN AND IT WAS PUT UP ON MY FACEBOOK PAGE LAST WEEK AND SOMEBODY WROTE IN HUH WHY DOES HE HAVE HIM STANDING AT ATTENTION LIKE THAT
tst2013.talkid1649_013 AND THEN THEY SAID BUT HE LOOKS GOOD
tst2013.talkid1649_014 HE DOES LOOK GOOD BECAUSE KIDS NEED STRUCTURE AND THE TRICK I PLAY IN ALL OF MY SCHOOL APPEARANCES IS THAT WHEN I GET THROUGH WITH MY LITTLE HOMILY TO THE KIDS I THEN INVITE THEM TO ASK QUESTIONS AND WHEN THEY RAISE THEIR HANDS I SAY COME UP AND I MAKE THEM COME UP AND STAND IN FRONT OF ME
tst2013.talkid1649_015 I MAKE THEM STAND AT ATTENTION LIKE A SOLDIER
tst2013.talkid1649_016 PUT YOUR ARMS STRAIGHT DOWN AT YOUR SIDE LOOK UP OPEN YOUR EYES STARE STRAIGHT AHEAD AND SPEAK OUT YOUR QUESTION LOUDLY SO EVERYBODY CAN HEAR
tst2013.talkid1649_017 NO SLOUCHING NO PANTS HANGING DOWN NONE OF THAT STUFF YOU KNOW
tst2013.talkid1649_018 AND THIS YOUNG MAN HIS NAME IS HIS LAST NAME CRUZ HE LOVED IT THAT'S ALL OVER HIS FACEBOOK PAGE AND IT'S GONE VIRAL
tst2013.talkid1649_019 SO PEOPLE THINK YOU KNOW I'M BEING UNKIND TO THIS KID
tst2013.talkid1649_020 NO WE'RE HAVING A LITTLE FUN
tst2013.talkid1649_021 AND THE THING ABOUT IT I'VE DONE THIS FOR YEARS THE YOUNGER THEY ARE THE MORE FUN IT IS
tst2013.talkid1649_022 WHEN I GET SIX AND SEVEN YEAR OLDS IN A GROUP I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO KEEP THEM QUIET
tst2013.talkid1649_023 YOU KNOW THAT THEY'LL ALWAYS START YAKKING
tst2013.talkid1649_024 AND SO I PLAY A LITTLE GAME WITH THEM BEFORE I MAKE THEM STAND AT ATTENTION
tst2013.talkid1649_025 I SAY NOW LISTEN IN THE ARMY WHEN WE WANT YOU TO PAY ATTENTION WE HAVE A COMMAND IT'S CALLED AT EASE IT MEANS EVERYBODY BE QUIET AND PAY ATTENTION LISTEN UP
tst2013.talkid1649_026 DO YOU UNDERSTAND
tst2013.talkid1649_027 UH HUH UH HUH UH HUH LET'S PRACTICE EVERYBODY START CHATTING
tst2013.talkid1649_028 AND I LET THEM GO FOR ABOUT TEN SECONDS THEN I GO AT EASE
tst2013.talkid1649_029 HUH
tst2013.talkid1649_030 YES GENERAL YES GENERAL
tst2013.talkid1649_031 TRY IT WITH YOUR KIDS SEE IF IT WORKS
tst2013.talkid1649_032 I DON'T THINK SO
tst2013.talkid1649_033 BUT ANYWAY IT'S A GAME I PLAY AND IT COMES OBVIOUSLY FROM MY MILITARY EXPERIENCE
tst2013.talkid1649_034 BECAUSE FOR THE MAJORITY OF MY ADULT LIFE I WORKED WITH YOUNG KIDS TEENAGERS WITH GUNS I CALL THEM
tst2013.talkid1649_035 AND WE WOULD BRING THEM INTO THE ARMY AND THE FIRST THING WE WOULD DO IS TO PUT THEM IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF STRUCTURE PUT THEM IN RANKS MAKE THEM ALL WEAR THE SAME CLOTHES CUT ALL THEIR HAIR OFF SO THEY LOOK ALIKE MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE STANDING IN RANKS
tst2013.talkid1649_036 WE TEACH THEM HOW TO GO RIGHT FACE LEFT FACE SO THEY CAN OBEY INSTRUCTIONS AND KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT OBEYING INSTRUCTIONS
tst2013.talkid1649_037 IT GIVES THEM STRUCTURE
tst2013.talkid1649_038 AND THEN WE INTRODUCE THEM TO SOMEBODY WHO THEY COME TO HATE IMMEDIATELY THE DRILL SERGEANT
tst2013.talkid1649_039 AND THEY HATE HIM
tst2013.talkid1649_040 AND THE DRILL SERGEANT STARTS SCREAMING AT THEM AND TELLING THEM TO DO ALL KINDS OF AWFUL THINGS
tst2013.talkid1649_041 BUT THEN THE MOST AMAZING THING HAPPENS OVER TIME
tst2013.talkid1649_042 ONCE THAT STRUCTURE IS DEVELOPED ONCE THEY UNDERSTAND THE REASON FOR SOMETHING ONCE THEY UNDERSTAND MAMA AIN'T HERE SON
tst2013.talkid1649_043 I'M YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE I'M YOUR DADDY AND YOUR MOMMY
tst2013.talkid1649_044 AND THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS YOU GOT THAT SON
tst2013.talkid1649_045 YEAH AND THEN WHEN I ASK YOU A QUESTION THERE ARE ONLY THREE POSSIBLE ANSWERS YES SIR NO SIR AND NO EXCUSE SIR
tst2013.talkid1649_046 DON'T START TELLING ME WHY YOU DIDN'T DO SOMETHING
tst2013.talkid1649_047 IT'S YES SIR NO SIR NO EXCUSE SIR
tst2013.talkid1649_048 YOU DIDN'T SHAVE BUT SIR NO DON'T TELL ME HOW OFTEN YOU SCRAPED YOUR FACE THIS MORNING
tst2013.talkid1649_049 I'M TELLING YOU YOU DIDN'T SHAVE
tst2013.talkid1649_050 NO EXCUSE SIR ATTABOY YOU'RE LEARNING FAST
tst2013.talkid1649_051 BUT YOU'D BE AMAZED AT WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH THEM ONCE YOU PUT THEM IN THAT STRUCTURE
tst2013.talkid1649_052 IN EIGHTEEN WEEKS THEY HAVE A SKILL THEY ARE MATURE
tst2013.talkid1649_053 AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY COME TO ADMIRE THE DRILL SERGEANT AND THEY NEVER FORGET THE DRILL SERGEANT
tst2013.talkid1649_054 THEY COME TO RESPECT HIM
tst2013.talkid1649_055 AND SO WE NEED MORE OF THIS KIND OF STRUCTURE AND RESPECT IN THE LIVES OF OUR CHILDREN
tst2013.talkid1649_056 I SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH YOUTH GROUPS AND I SAY TO PEOPLE WHEN DOES THE EDUCATION PROCESS BEGIN
tst2013.talkid1649_057 WE'RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT LET'S FIX THE SCHOOLS
tst2013.talkid1649_058 LET'S DO MORE FOR OUR TEACHERS LET'S PUT MORE COMPUTERS IN OUR SCHOOLS
tst2013.talkid1649_059 LET'S GET IT ALL ONLINE
tst2013.talkid1649_060 THAT ISN'T THE WHOLE ANSWER IT'S PART OF THE ANSWER
tst2013.talkid1649_061 BUT THE REAL ANSWER BEGINS WITH BRINGING A CHILD TO THE SCHOOL WITH STRUCTURE IN THAT CHILD'S HEART AND SOUL TO BEGIN WITH
tst2013.talkid1649_062 WHEN DOES THE LEARNING PROCESS BEGIN DOES IT BEGIN IN FIRST GRADE
tst2013.talkid1649_063 NO NO IT BEGINS THE FIRST TIME A CHILD IN A MOTHER'S ARMS LOOKS UP AT THE MOTHER AND SAYS OH THIS MUST BE MY MOTHER
tst2013.talkid1649_064 SHE'S THE ONE WHO FEEDS ME
tst2013.talkid1649_065 OH YEAH WHEN I DON'T FEEL SO GOOD DOWN THERE SHE KIND OF YOU KNOW TAKES CARE OF ME
tst2013.talkid1649_066 IT'S HER LANGUAGE I WILL LEARN
tst2013.talkid1649_067 AND AT THAT MOMENT THEY SHUT OUT ALL THE OTHER LANGUAGES THAT THEY COULD BE LEARNING AT THAT AGE BUT BY THREE MONTHS THAT'S HER
tst2013.talkid1649_068 AND IF THE PERSON DOING IT WHETHER IT'S THE MOTHER OR GRANDMOTHER WHOEVER'S DOING IT THAT IS WHEN THE EDUCATION PROCESS BEGINS
tst2013.talkid1649_069 THAT'S WHEN LANGUAGE BEGINS
tst2013.talkid1649_070 THAT'S WHEN LOVE BEGINS THAT'S WHEN STRUCTURE BEGINS
tst2013.talkid1649_071 THAT'S WHEN YOU START TO IMPRINT ON THE CHILD THAT YOU ARE SPECIAL YOU ARE DIFFERENT FROM EVERY OTHER CHILD IN THE WORLD
tst2013.talkid1649_072 AND WE'RE GOING TO READ TO YOU
tst2013.talkid1649_073 A CHILD WHO HAS NOT BEEN READ TO IS IN DANGER WHEN THAT CHILD GETS TO SCHOOL
tst2013.talkid1649_074 A CHILD WHO DOESN'T KNOW HIS OR HER COLORS OR DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO TELL TIME DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO TIE SHOES DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO DO THOSE THINGS AND DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO DO SOMETHING THAT GOES BY A WORD THAT WAS DRILLED INTO ME AS A KID MIND
tst2013.talkid1649_075 MIND YOUR MANNERS MIND YOUR ADULTS MIND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
tst2013.talkid1649_076 THIS IS THE WAY CHILDREN ARE RAISED PROPERLY
tst2013.talkid1649_077 AND I WATCHED MY OWN YOUNG GRANDCHILDREN NOW COME ALONG AND THEY'RE MUCH TO THE DISTRESS OF MY MY CHILDREN THEY ARE ACTING JUST LIKE WE DID YOU KNOW YOU IMPRINT THEM
tst2013.talkid1649_078 AND THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO TO PREPARE CHILDREN FOR EDUCATION AND FOR SCHOOL
tst2013.talkid1649_079 AND I'M WORKING AT ALL THE ENERGY I HAVE TO SORT OF COMMUNICATE THIS MESSAGE THAT WE NEED PRESCHOOL WE NEED HEAD START WE NEED PRENATAL CARE
tst2013.talkid1649_080 THE EDUCATION PROCESS BEGINS EVEN BEFORE THE CHILD IS BORN AND IF YOU DON'T DO THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE DIFFICULTY
tst2013.talkid1649_081 AND WE ARE HAVING DIFFICULTIES IN SO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES AND SO MANY OF OUR SCHOOLS WHERE KIDS ARE COMING TO FIRST GRADE AND THEIR EYES ARE BLAZING THEY'VE GOT THEIR LITTLE KNAPSACK ON AND THEY'RE READY TO GO AND THEN THEY REALIZE THEY'RE NOT LIKE THE OTHER FIRST GRADERS WHO KNOW BOOKS HAVE BEEN READ TO CAN DO THEIR ALPHABET
tst2013.talkid1649_082 AND BY THE THIRD GRADE THE KIDS WHO DIDN'T HAVE THAT STRUCTURE AND MINDING IN THE BEGINNING START TO REALIZE THEY'RE BEHIND AND WHAT DO THEY DO
tst2013.talkid1649_083 THEY ACT IT OUT THEY ACT IT OUT AND THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY TO JAIL OR THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY TO BEING DROPOUTS
tst2013.talkid1649_084 IT'S PREDICTABLE
tst2013.talkid1649_085 IF YOU'RE NOT AT THE RIGHT READING LEVEL AT THIRD GRADE YOU ARE A CANDIDATE FOR JAIL AT AGE EIGHTEEN AND WE HAVE THE HIGHEST INCARCERATION RATE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GETTING OUR KIDS THE PROPER START IN LIFE
tst2013.talkid1649_086 THE LAST CHAPTER IN MY BOOK IS CALLED THE GIFT OF A GOOD START
tst2013.talkid1649_087 THE GIFT OF A GOOD START EVERY CHILD OUGHT TO HAVE A GOOD START IN LIFE
tst2013.talkid1649_088 I WAS PRIVILEGED TO HAVE THAT KIND OF GOOD START
tst2013.talkid1649_089 I WAS NOT A GREAT STUDENT
tst2013.talkid1649_090 I WAS A PUBLIC SCHOOL KID IN NEW YORK CITY AND I DIDN'T DO WELL AT ALL
tst2013.talkid1649_091 I HAVE MY ENTIRE NEW YORK CITY BOARD OF EDUCATION TRANSCRIPT FROM KINDERGARTEN THROUGH COLLEGE
tst2013.talkid1649_092 I WANTED IT WHEN I WAS WRITING MY FIRST BOOK
tst2013.talkid1649_093 I WANTED TO SEE IF MY MEMORY WAS CORRECT AND MY GOD IT WAS
tst2013.talkid1649_094 STRAIGHT C EVERYWHERE
tst2013.talkid1649_095 AND I FINALLY BOUNCED THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL GOT INTO THE CITY COLLEGE OF NEW YORK WITH A SEVENTY EIGHT POINT THREE AVERAGE WHICH I SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ALLOWED IN WITH AND THEN I STARTED OUT IN ENGINEERING AND THAT ONLY LASTED SIX MONTHS
tst2013.talkid1649_096 AND THEN I WENT INTO GEOLOGY ROCKS FOR JOCKS THIS IS EASY
tst2013.talkid1649_097 AND THEN I FOUND ROTC
tst2013.talkid1649_098 I FOUND SOMETHING THAT I DID WELL AND SOMETHING THAT I LOVED DOING AND I FOUND A GROUP OF YOUNGSTERS LIKE ME WHO FELT THE SAME WAY
tst2013.talkid1649_099 AND SO MY WHOLE LIFE THEN WAS DEDICATED TO ROTC AND THE MILITARY
tst2013.talkid1649_100 AND I SAY TO YOUNG KIDS EVERYWHERE AS YOU'RE GROWING UP AND AS THIS STRUCTURE IS BEING DEVELOPED INSIDE OF YOU ALWAYS BE LOOKING FOR THAT WHICH YOU DO WELL AND THAT WHICH YOU LOVE DOING AND WHEN YOU FIND THOSE TWO THINGS TOGETHER MAN YOU GOT IT
tst2013.talkid1649_101 THAT'S WHAT'S GOING ON AND THAT'S WHAT I FOUND
tst2013.talkid1649_102 NOW THE AUTHORITIES AT CCNY WERE GETTING TIRED OF ME BEING THERE
tst2013.talkid1649_103 I'D BEEN THERE FOUR AND A HALF GOING ON FIVE YEARS AND MY GRADES WERE NOT DOING PARTICULARLY WELL AND I WAS IN OCCASIONAL DIFFICULTIES WITH THE ADMINISTRATION
tst2013.talkid1649_104 AND SO THEY SAID BUT HE DOES SO WELL IN ROTC
tst2013.talkid1649_105 LOOK HE GETS STRAIGHT A'S IN THAT BUT NOT IN ANYTHING ELSE
tst2013.talkid1649_106 AND SO THEY SAID LOOK LET'S LET'S TAKE HIS ROTC GRADES AND ROLL THEM INTO HIS OVERALL GPA AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS
tst2013.talkid1649_107 AND THEY DID AND IT BROUGHT ME UP TO TWO POINT OH
tst2013.talkid1649_108 YEP
tst2013.talkid1649_109 THEY SAID IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR GOVERNMENT WORK
tst2013.talkid1649_110 GIVE HIM TO THE ARMY WE'LL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN WE'LL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN
tst2013.talkid1649_111 SO THEY SHIPPED ME OFF TO THE ARMY AND LO AND BEHOLD MANY YEARS LATER I'M CONSIDERED ONE OF THE GREATEST SONS THE CITY COLLEGE OF NEW YORK HAS EVER HAD
tst2013.talkid1649_112 SO I TELL YOUNG PEOPLE EVERYWHERE IT AIN'T WHERE YOU START IN LIFE IT'S WHAT YOU DO WITH LIFE THAT DETERMINES WHERE YOU END UP IN LIFE AND YOU ARE BLESSED TO BE LIVING IN A COUNTRY THAT NO MATTER WHERE YOU START YOU HAVE OPPORTUNITIES SO LONG AS YOU BELIEVE IN YOURSELF YOU BELIEVE IN THE SOCIETY AND THE COUNTRY AND YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN SELF IMPROVE AND EDUCATE YOURSELF AS YOU GO ALONG
tst2013.talkid1649_113 AND THAT'S THE KEY TO SUCCESS
tst2013.talkid1649_114 BUT IT BEGINS WITH THE GIFT OF A GOOD START
tst2013.talkid1649_115 IF WE DON'T GIVE THAT GIFT TO EACH AND EVERY ONE OF OUR KIDS IF WE DON'T INVEST AT THE EARLIEST AGE WE'RE GOING TO BE RUNNING INTO DIFFICULTIES
tst2013.talkid1649_116 IT'S WHY WE HAVE A DROPOUT RATE OF ROUGHLY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OVERALL AND ALMOST FIFTY PERCENT OF OUR MINORITY POPULATION LIVING IN LOW INCOME AREAS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GETTING THE GIFT OF A GOOD START
tst2013.talkid1649_117 MY GIFT OF A GOOD START WAS NOT ONLY BEING IN A NICE FAMILY A GOOD FAMILY BUT HAVING A FAMILY THAT SAID TO ME NOW LISTEN WE CAME TO THIS COUNTRY IN BANANA BOATS IN NINETEEN TWENTY AND NINETEEN TWENTY FOUR
tst2013.talkid1649_118 WE WORKED LIKE DOGS DOWN IN THE GARMENT INDUSTRY EVERY SINGLE DAY
tst2013.talkid1649_119 WE'RE NOT DOING IT SO THAT YOU CAN STICK SOMETHING UP YOUR NOSE OR GET IN TROUBLE AND DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT DROPPING OUT
tst2013.talkid1649_120 IF I HAD EVER GONE HOME AND TOLD THOSE IMMIGRANT PEOPLE THAT YOU KNOW I'M TIRED OF SCHOOL AND I'M DROPPING OUT THEY'D SAID WE'RE DROPPING YOU OUT WE'LL GET ANOTHER KID
tst2013.talkid1649_121 THEY HAD EXPECTATIONS FOR ALL OF THE COUSINS AND THE EXTENDED FAMILY OF IMMIGRANTS THAT LIVED IN THE SOUTH BRONX BUT THEY HAD MORE THAN JUST EXPECTATIONS FOR US
tst2013.talkid1649_122 THEY STUCK INTO OUR HEARTS LIKE A DAGGER A SENSE OF SHAME DON'T YOU SHAME THIS FAMILY
tst2013.talkid1649_123 SOMETIMES I WOULD GET IN TROUBLE AND MY PARENTS WERE COMING HOME AND I WAS IN MY ROOM WAITING FOR WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND I WOULD SIT THERE SAYING TO MYSELF OKAY LOOK TAKE THE BELT AND HIT ME BUT GOD DON'T GIVE ME THAT SHAME THE FAMILY BIT AGAIN
tst2013.talkid1649_124 IT DEVASTATED ME WHEN MY MOTHER DID THAT TO ME
tst2013.talkid1649_125 AND I ALSO HAD THIS EXTENDED NETWORK
tst2013.talkid1649_126 CHILDREN NEED A NETWORK CHILDREN NEED TO BE PART OF A TRIBE A FAMILY A COMMUNITY
tst2013.talkid1649_127 IN MY CASE IT WAS AUNTS WHO LIVED IN ALL OF THESE TENEMENT BUILDINGS
tst2013.talkid1649_128 I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU ARE NEW YORKERS BUT THERE WERE THESE TENEMENT BUILDINGS AND THESE WOMEN WERE ALWAYS HANGING OUT ONE OF THE WINDOWS LEANING ON A PILLOW
tst2013.talkid1649_129 THEY NEVER LEFT
tst2013.talkid1649_130 I SO HELP ME GOD I GREW UP WALKING THOSE STREETS AND THEY WERE ALWAYS THERE
tst2013.talkid1649_131 THEY NEVER WENT TO THE BATHROOM THEY NEVER COOKED
tst2013.talkid1649_132 THEY NEVER DID ANYTHING
tst2013.talkid1649_133 BUT WHAT THEY DID WAS KEEP US IN PLAY
tst2013.talkid1649_134 THEY KEPT US IN PLAY
tst2013.talkid1649_135 AND THEY DIDN'T CARE WHETHER YOU BECAME A DOCTOR OR A LAWYER OR A GENERAL AND THEY NEVER EXPECTED ANY GENERALS IN THE FAMILY AS LONG AS YOU GOT AN EDUCATION AND THEN YOU GOT A JOB
tst2013.talkid1649_136 DON'T GIVE US ANY OF THAT SELF ACTUALIZATION STUFF
tst2013.talkid1649_137 YOU GET A JOB AND GET OUT OF THE HOUSE
tst2013.talkid1649_138 WE DON'T HAVE TIME TO WASTE FOR THAT
tst2013.talkid1649_139 AND THEN YOU CAN SUPPORT US THAT'S THE THAT'S THE ROLE OF YOU GUYS
tst2013.talkid1649_140 AND SO IT'S SO ESSENTIAL THAT WE KIND OF PUT THIS CULTURE BACK INTO OUR FAMILIES ALL FAMILIES
tst2013.talkid1649_141 AND IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT ALL OF YOU HERE TODAY WHO ARE SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE AND I'M SURE HAVE WONDERFUL FAMILIES AND CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN IT'S NOT ENOUGH YOU'VE GOT TO REACH OUT AND BACK AND FIND KIDS LIKE MR CRUZ WHO CAN MAKE IT IF YOU GIVE THEM THE STRUCTURE IF YOU REACH BACK AND HELP IF YOU MENTOR IF YOU INVEST IN BOYS AND GIRLS CLUBS IF YOU WORK WITH YOUR SCHOOL SYSTEM MAKE SURE IT'S THE BEST SCHOOL SYSTEM AND NOT JUST YOUR KID'S SCHOOL BUT THE SCHOOL UPTOWN IN HARLEM NOT JUST DOWNTOWN MONTESSORI ON THE WEST SIDE
tst2013.talkid1649_142 ALL OF US HAVE TO HAVE A COMMITMENT TO DO THAT
tst2013.talkid1649_143 AND WE'RE NOT JUST INVESTING IN THE KIDS
tst2013.talkid1649_144 WE'RE INVESTING IN OUR FUTURE
tst2013.talkid1649_145 WE'RE GOING TO BE A MINORITY MAJORITY COUNTRY IN ONE MORE GENERATION
tst2013.talkid1649_146 THOSE THAT WE CALL MINORITIES NOW ARE GOING TO BE THE MAJORITY
tst2013.talkid1649_147 AND WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE READY TO BE THE MAJORITY
tst2013.talkid1649_148 WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE READY TO BE THE LEADERS OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY OF OURS A COUNTRY THAT IS LIKE NO OTHER A COUNTRY THAT AMAZES ME EVERY SINGLE DAY A COUNTRY THAT'S FRACTIOUS WE'RE ALWAYS ARGUING WITH EACH OTHER
tst2013.talkid1649_149 THAT'S HOW THE SYSTEM'S SUPPOSED TO WORK
tst2013.talkid1649_150 IT'S A COUNTRY OF SUCH CONTRASTS BUT IT'S A NATION OF NATIONS
tst2013.talkid1649_151 WE TOUCH EVERY NATION EVERY NATION TOUCHES US
tst2013.talkid1649_152 WE ARE A NATION OF IMMIGRANTS
tst2013.talkid1649_153 THAT'S WHY WE NEED SOUND IMMIGRATION POLICY
tst2013.talkid1649_154 IT'S RIDICULOUS NOT TO HAVE A SOUND IMMIGRATION POLICY TO WELCOME THOSE WHO WANT TO COME HERE AND BE PART OF THIS GREAT NATION OR WE CAN SEND BACK HOME WITH AN EDUCATION TO HELP THEIR PEOPLE RISE UP OUT OF POVERTY
tst2013.talkid1649_155 ONE OF THE GREAT STORIES I LOVE TO TELL IS ABOUT MY LOVE OF GOING TO MY HOMETOWN OF NEW YORK AND WALKING UP PARK AVENUE ON A BEAUTIFUL DAY AND ADMIRING EVERYTHING AND SEEING ALL THE PEOPLE GO BY FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD
tst2013.talkid1649_156 BUT WHAT I ALWAYS HAVE TO DO IS STOP AT ONE OF THE CORNERS AND GET A HOT DOG FROM THE IMMIGRANT PUSHCART PEDDLER
tst2013.talkid1649_157 GOTTA HAVE A DIRTY WATER DOG
tst2013.talkid1649_158 AND NO MATTER WHERE I AM OR WHAT I'M DOING I'VE GOT TO DO THAT
tst2013.talkid1649_159 I EVEN DID IT WHEN I WAS SECRETARY OF STATE
tst2013.talkid1649_160 I'D COME OUT OF MY SUITE AT THE WALDORF ASTORIA BE WALKING UP THE STREET AND I WOULD HIT AROUND FIFTY FIFTH STREET LOOKING FOR THE IMMIGRANT PUSHCART PEDDLER
tst2013.talkid1649_161 IN THOSE DAYS I HAD FIVE BODYGUARDS AROUND ME AND THREE NEW YORK CITY POLICE CARS WOULD ROLL ALONGSIDE TO MAKE SURE I DIDN'T GET NOBODY WHACKED ME WHILE I WAS GOING UP PARK AVENUE
tst2013.talkid1649_162 AND I WOULD ORDER THE HOT DOG FROM THE GUY AND HE'D START TO FIX IT AND THEN HE'D LOOK AROUND AT THE BODYGUARDS AND THE POLICE CARS I'VE GOT A GREEN CARD I'VE GOT A GREEN CARD
tst2013.talkid1649_163 IT'S OKAY IT'S OKAY
tst2013.talkid1649_164 BUT NOW I'M ALONE I'M ALONE
tst2013.talkid1649_165 I'VE GOT NO BODYGUARDS I'VE GOT NO POLICE CARS I'VE GOT NOTHING
tst2013.talkid1649_166 BUT I GOTTA HAVE MY HOT DOG
tst2013.talkid1649_167 I DID IT JUST LAST WEEK IT WAS ON A TUESDAY EVENING DOWN BY COLUMBUS CIRCLE
tst2013.talkid1649_168 AND THE SCENE REPEATS ITSELF SO OFTEN
tst2013.talkid1649_169 I'LL GO UP AND ASK FOR MY HOT DOG AND THE GUY WILL FIX IT AND AS HE'S FINISHING HE'LL SAY I KNOW YOU I SEE YOU ON TELEVISION
tst2013.talkid1649_170 YOU'RE WELL YOU'RE GENERAL POWELL
tst2013.talkid1649_171 YES YES OH I HAND HIM THE MONEY
tst2013.talkid1649_172 NO GENERAL YOU CAN'T PAY ME I'VE BEEN PAID
tst2013.talkid1649_173 AMERICA HAS PAID ME I NEVER FORGET WHERE I CAME FROM
tst2013.talkid1649_174 BUT NOW I'M AN AMERICAN SIR THANK YOU
tst2013.talkid1649_175 I ACCEPT THE GENEROSITY CONTINUE UP THE STREET AND IT WASHES OVER ME MY GOD IT'S THE SAME COUNTRY THAT GREETED MY PARENTS THIS WAY NINETY YEARS AGO
tst2013.talkid1649_176 SO WE ARE STILL THAT MAGNIFICENT COUNTRY BUT WE ARE FUELED BY YOUNG PEOPLE COMING UP FROM EVERY LAND IN THE WORLD AND IT IS OUR OBLIGATION AS CONTRIBUTING CITIZENS TO THIS WONDERFUL COUNTRY OF OURS TO MAKE SURE THAT NO CHILD GETS LEFT BEHIND
tst2013.talkid1649_177 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
tst2013.talkid1651_000 THIS IS HOW WAR STARTS
tst2013.talkid1651_001 ONE DAY YOU'RE LIVING YOUR ORDINARY LIFE YOU'RE PLANNING TO GO TO A PARTY YOU'RE TAKING YOUR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL YOU'RE MAKING A DENTIST APPOINTMENT
tst2013.talkid1651_002 THE NEXT THING THE TELEPHONES GO OUT THE TVS GO OUT THERE'S ARMED MEN ON THE STREET THERE'S ROADBLOCKS
tst2013.talkid1651_003 YOUR LIFE AS YOU KNOW IT GOES INTO SUSPENDED ANIMATION
tst2013.talkid1651_004 IT STOPS
tst2013.talkid1651_005 I'M GOING TO STEAL A STORY FROM A FRIEND OF MINE A BOSNIAN FRIEND ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HER BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL ILLUSTRATE FOR YOU EXACTLY WHAT IT FEELS LIKE
tst2013.talkid1651_006 SHE WAS WALKING TO WORK ONE DAY IN APRIL NINETEEN NINETY TWO IN A MINISKIRT AND HIGH HEELS SHE WORKED IN A BANK
tst2013.talkid1651_007 SHE WAS A YOUNG MOTHER SHE WAS SOMEONE WHO LIKED TO PARTY
tst2013.talkid1651_008 GREAT PERSON
tst2013.talkid1651_009 AND SUDDENLY SHE SEES A TANK AMBLING DOWN THE MAIN ROAD OF SARAJEVO KNOCKING EVERYTHING OUT OF ITS PATH
tst2013.talkid1651_010 SHE THINKS SHE'S DREAMING BUT SHE'S NOT
tst2013.talkid1651_011 AND SHE RUNS AS ANY OF US WOULD HAVE DONE AND TAKES COVER AND SHE HIDES BEHIND A TRASH BIN IN HER HIGH HEELS AND HER MINISKIRT
tst2013.talkid1651_012 AND AS SHE'S HIDING THERE SHE'S FEELING RIDICULOUS BUT SHE'S SEEING THIS TANK GO BY WITH SOLDIERS AND PEOPLE ALL OVER THE PLACE AND CHAOS AND SHE THINKS I FEEL LIKE ALICE IN WONDERLAND GOING DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE DOWN DOWN DOWN INTO CHAOS AND MY LIFE WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN
tst2013.talkid1651_013 A FEW WEEKS LATER MY FRIEND WAS IN A CROWD OF PEOPLE PUSHING WITH HER INFANT SON IN HER ARMS TO GIVE HIM TO A STRANGER ON A BUS WHICH WAS ONE OF THE LAST BUSES LEAVING SARAJEVO TO TAKE CHILDREN OUT SO THEY COULD BE SAFE
tst2013.talkid1651_014 AND SHE REMEMBERS STRUGGLING WITH HER MOTHER TO THE FRONT CROWDS AND CROWDS OF PEOPLE TAKE MY CHILD TAKE MY CHILD
tst2013.talkid1651_015 AND PASSING HER SON TO SOMEONE THROUGH A WINDOW
tst2013.talkid1651_016 AND SHE DIDN'T SEE HIM FOR YEARS
tst2013.talkid1651_017 THE SIEGE WENT ON FOR THREE AND A HALF YEARS AND IT WAS A SIEGE WITHOUT WATER WITHOUT POWER WITHOUT ELECTRICITY WITHOUT HEAT WITHOUT FOOD IN THE MIDDLE OF EUROPE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
tst2013.talkid1651_018 I HAD THE HONOR OF BEING ONE OF THOSE REPORTERS THAT LIVED THROUGH THAT SIEGE AND I SAY I HAVE THE HONOR AND THE PRIVILEGE OF BEING THERE BECAUSE IT'S TAUGHT ME EVERYTHING NOT JUST ABOUT BEING A REPORTER BUT ABOUT BEING A HUMAN BEING
tst2013.talkid1651_019 I LEARNED ABOUT COMPASSION
tst2013.talkid1651_020 I LEARNED ABOUT ORDINARY PEOPLE WHO COULD BE HEROES
tst2013.talkid1651_021 I LEARNED ABOUT SHARING I LEARNED ABOUT CAMARADERIE
tst2013.talkid1651_022 MOST OF ALL I LEARNED ABOUT LOVE
tst2013.talkid1651_023 EVEN IN THE MIDST OF TERRIBLE DESTRUCTION AND DEATH AND CHAOS I LEARNED HOW ORDINARY PEOPLE COULD HELP THEIR NEIGHBORS SHARE FOOD RAISE THEIR CHILDREN DRAG SOMEONE WHO'S BEING SNIPED AT FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD EVEN THOUGH YOU YOURSELF WERE ENDANGERING YOUR LIFE HELPING PEOPLE GET INTO TAXIS WHO WERE INJURED TO TRY TO TAKE THEM TO HOSPITALS
tst2013.talkid1651_024 I LEARNED SO MUCH ABOUT MYSELF
tst2013.talkid1651_025 MARTHA GELLHORN WHO'S ONE OF MY HEROES ONCE SAID YOU CAN ONLY LOVE ONE WAR THE REST IS RESPONSIBILITY
tst2013.talkid1651_026 I WENT ON TO COVER MANY MANY MANY WARS AFTER THAT SO MANY THAT I LOST COUNT BUT THERE WAS NOTHING LIKE SARAJEVO
tst2013.talkid1651_027 LAST APRIL I WENT BACK TO A VERY STRANGE WHAT I CALLED A DERANGED HIGH SCHOOL REUNION
tst2013.talkid1651_028 WHAT IT WAS WAS THE TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SIEGE THE BEGINNING OF THE SIEGE OF SARAJEVO AND I DON'T LIKE THE WORD ANNIVERSARY BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE A PARTY AND THIS WAS NOT A PARTY
tst2013.talkid1651_029 IT WAS A VERY SOMBER GATHERING OF THE REPORTERS THAT WORKED THERE DURING THE WAR HUMANITARIAN AID WORKERS AND OF COURSE THE BRAVE AND COURAGEOUS PEOPLE OF SARAJEVO THEMSELVES
tst2013.talkid1651_030 AND THE THING THAT STRUCK ME THE MOST THAT BROKE MY HEART WAS WALKING DOWN THE MAIN STREET OF SARAJEVO WHERE MY FRIEND AIDA SAW THE TANK COMING TWENTY YEARS AGO AND IN THAT ROAD WERE TWELVE THOUSAND MORE THAN TWELVE THOUSAND RED CHAIRS AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM SYMBOLIZED A PERSON WHO HAD DIED DURING THE SIEGE JUST IN SARAJEVO NOT IN ALL OF BOSNIA AND IT STRETCHED FROM ONE END OF THE CITY TO A LARGE PART OF IT AND THE SADDEST FOR ME WERE THE TINY LITTLE CHAIRS FOR THE CHILDREN
tst2013.talkid1651_031 I NOW COVER SYRIA AND I STARTED REPORTING IT BECAUSE I BELIEVED THAT IT NEEDS TO BE DONE
tst2013.talkid1651_032 I BELIEVE A STORY THERE HAS TO BE TOLD
tst2013.talkid1651_033 I SEE AGAIN A TEMPLATE OF THE WAR IN BOSNIA
tst2013.talkid1651_034 AND WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED IN DAMASCUS I SAW THIS STRANGE MOMENT WHERE PEOPLE DIDN'T SEEM TO BELIEVE THAT WAR WAS GOING TO DESCEND AND IT WAS EXACTLY THE SAME IN BOSNIA AND NEARLY EVERY OTHER COUNTRY I'VE SEEN WHERE WAR COMES
tst2013.talkid1651_035 PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO BELIEVE IT'S COMING SO THEY DON'T LEAVE THEY DON'T LEAVE BEFORE THEY CAN
tst2013.talkid1651_036 THEY DON'T GET THEIR MONEY OUT
tst2013.talkid1651_037 THEY STAY BECAUSE YOU WANT TO STAY IN YOUR HOME
tst2013.talkid1651_038 AND THEN WAR AND CHAOS DESCEND
tst2013.talkid1651_039 RWANDA IS A PLACE THAT HAUNTS ME A LOT
tst2013.talkid1651_040 IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR I BRIEFLY LEFT SARAJEVO TO GO REPORT THE GENOCIDE IN RWANDA
tst2013.talkid1651_041 BETWEEN APRIL AND AUGUST NINETEEN NINETY FOUR ONE MILLION PEOPLE WERE SLAUGHTERED
tst2013.talkid1651_042 NOW IF THOSE TWELVE THOUSAND CHAIRS FREAKED ME OUT WITH THE SHEER NUMBER I WANT YOU JUST FOR A SECOND TO THINK OF A MILLION PEOPLE
tst2013.talkid1651_043 AND TO GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLE I REMEMBER STANDING AND LOOKING DOWN A ROAD AS FAR AS I COULD SEE AT LEAST A MILE AND THERE WERE BODIES PILED TWICE MY HEIGHT OF THE DEAD
tst2013.talkid1651_044 AND THAT WAS JUST A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE DEAD
tst2013.talkid1651_045 AND THERE WERE MOTHERS HOLDING THEIR CHILDREN WHO HAD BEEN CAUGHT IN THEIR LAST DEATH THROES
tst2013.talkid1651_046 SO WE LEARN A LOT FROM WAR AND I MENTION RWANDA BECAUSE IT IS ONE PLACE LIKE SOUTH AFRICA WHERE NEARLY TWENTY YEARS ON THERE IS HEALING
tst2013.talkid1651_047 FIFTY SIX PERCENT OF THE PARLIAMENTARIANS ARE WOMEN WHICH IS FANTASTIC AND THERE'S ALSO WITHIN THE NATIONAL CONSTITUTION NOW YOU'RE YOU'RE ACTUALLY NOT ALLOWED TO SAY HUTU OR TUTSI
tst2013.talkid1651_048 YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO IDENTIFY ANYONE BY ETHNICITY WHICH IS OF COURSE WHAT STARTED THE SLAUGHTER IN THE FIRST PLACE
tst2013.talkid1651_049 AND AN AID WORKER FRIEND OF MINE TOLD ME THE MOST BEAUTIFUL STORY OR I FIND IT BEAUTIFUL
tst2013.talkid1651_050 THERE WAS A GROUP OF CHILDREN MIXED HUTUS AND TUTSIS AND A GROUP OF WOMEN WHO WERE ADOPTING THEM AND THEY LINED UP AND ONE WAS JUST GIVEN TO THE NEXT
tst2013.talkid1651_051 THERE WAS NO KIND OF COMPENSATION FOR YOU'RE A TUTSI YOU'RE A HUTU YOU MIGHT HAVE KILLED MY MOTHER YOU MIGHT HAVE KILLED MY FATHER
tst2013.talkid1651_052 THEY WERE JUST BROUGHT TOGETHER IN THIS KIND OF RECONCILIATION AND I FIND THIS REMARKABLE
tst2013.talkid1651_053 SO WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME HOW I CONTINUE TO COVER WAR AND WHY I CONTINUE TO DO IT THIS IS WHY
tst2013.talkid1651_054 WHEN I GO BACK TO SYRIA NEXT WEEK IN FACT WHAT I SEE IS INCREDIBLY HEROIC PEOPLE SOME OF THEM FIGHTING FOR DEMOCRACY FOR THINGS WE TAKE FOR GRANTED EVERY SINGLE DAY
tst2013.talkid1651_055 AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHY I DO IT
tst2013.talkid1651_056 IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR I HAD A LITTLE BABY BOY AND I CALL HIM MY MIRACLE CHILD BECAUSE AFTER SEEING SO MUCH DEATH AND DESTRUCTION AND CHAOS AND DARKNESS IN MY LIFE THIS RAY OF HOPE WAS BORN
tst2013.talkid1651_057 AND I CALLED HIM LUCA WHICH MEANS THE BRINGER OF LIGHT BECAUSE HE DID BRING HE DOES BRING LIFE LIGHT TO MY LIFE
tst2013.talkid1651_058 BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT HIM BECAUSE WHEN HE WAS FOUR MONTHS OLD MY FOREIGN EDITOR FORCED ME TO GO BACK TO BAGHDAD WHERE I HAD BEEN REPORTING ALL THROUGHOUT THE SADDAM REGIME AND DURING THE FALL OF BAGHDAD AND AFTERWARDS AND I REMEMBER GETTING ON THE PLANE IN TEARS CRYING TO BE SEPARATED FROM MY SON AND WHILE I WAS THERE A QUITE FAMOUS IRAQI POLITICIAN WHO WAS A FRIEND OF MINE SAID TO ME WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
tst2013.talkid1651_059 WHY AREN'T YOU HOME WITH LUCA
tst2013.talkid1651_060 AND I SAID WELL I HAVE TO SEE IT WAS TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR WHICH WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE INCREDIBLY BLOODY TIME IN IRAQ I HAVE TO SEE I HAVE TO SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE
tst2013.talkid1651_061 I HAVE TO REPORT IT
tst2013.talkid1651_062 AND HE SAID GO HOME BECAUSE IF YOU MISS HIS FIRST TOOTH IF YOU MISS HIS FIRST STEP YOU'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOURSELF
tst2013.talkid1651_063 BUT THERE WILL ALWAYS BE ANOTHER WAR
tst2013.talkid1651_064 AND THERE SADLY WILL ALWAYS BE WARS
tst2013.talkid1651_065 AND I AM DELUDING MYSELF IF I THINK AS A JOURNALIST AS A REPORTER AS A WRITER WHAT I DO CAN STOP THEM I CAN'T
tst2013.talkid1651_066 I'M NOT KOFI ANNAN HE CAN'T STOP A WAR
tst2013.talkid1651_067 HE TRIED TO NEGOTIATE SYRIA AND COULDN'T DO IT
tst2013.talkid1651_068 I'M NOT A UN CONFLICT RESOLUTION PERSON
tst2013.talkid1651_069 I'M NOT EVEN A HUMANITARIAN AID DOCTOR AND I CAN'T TELL YOU THE TIMES OF HOW HELPLESS I'VE FELT TO HAVE PEOPLE DYING IN FRONT OF ME AND I COULDN'T SAVE THEM
tst2013.talkid1651_070 ALL I AM IS A WITNESS
tst2013.talkid1651_071 MY ROLE IS TO BRING A VOICE TO PEOPLE WHO ARE VOICELESS
tst2013.talkid1651_072 A COLLEAGUE OF MINE DESCRIBED IT AS TO SHINE A LIGHT IN THE DARKEST CORNERS OF THE WORLD
tst2013.talkid1651_073 AND THAT'S WHAT I TRY TO DO
tst2013.talkid1651_074 I'M NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL AND SOMETIMES IT'S INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING BECAUSE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE WRITING INTO A VOID OR YOU FEEL LIKE NO ONE CARES
tst2013.talkid1651_075 WHO CARES ABOUT SYRIA WHO CARES ABOUT BOSNIA
tst2013.talkid1651_076 WHO CARES ABOUT THE CONGO THE IVORY COAST LIBERIA SIERRA LEONE ALL OF THESE STRINGS OF PLACES THAT I WILL REMEMBER FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE
tst2013.talkid1651_077 BUT MY MÃ©TIER IS TO BEAR WITNESS AND THAT IS THE CRUX THE HEART OF THE MATTER FOR US REPORTERS WHO DO THIS
tst2013.talkid1651_078 AND ALL I CAN REALLY DO IS HOPE NOT TO POLICYMAKERS OR POLITICIANS BECAUSE AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO HAVE FAITH THAT THEY READ MY WORDS AND DO SOMETHING I DON'T DELUDE MYSELF
tst2013.talkid1651_079 BUT WHAT I DO HOPE IS THAT IF YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING I SAID OR ANY OF MY STORIES TOMORROW MORNING OVER BREAKFAST IF YOU CAN REMEMBER THE STORY OF SARAJEVO OR THE STORY OF RWANDA THEN I'VE DONE MY JOB
tst2013.talkid1651_080 THANK YOU VERY MUCH
tst2013.talkid1654_000 I'M HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT A DISTURBING QUESTION WHICH HAS AN EQUALLY DISTURBING ANSWER
tst2013.talkid1654_001 MY TOPIC IS THE SECRETS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THE QUESTION I'M GOING TO TACKLE IS THE ONE QUESTION EVERYONE ALWAYS ASKS WHY DOES SHE STAY
tst2013.talkid1654_002 WHY WOULD ANYONE STAY WITH A MAN WHO BEATS HER
tst2013.talkid1654_003 I'M NOT A PSYCHIATRIST A SOCIAL WORKER OR AN EXPERT IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
tst2013.talkid1654_004 I'M JUST ONE WOMAN WITH A STORY TO TELL
tst2013.talkid1654_005 I WAS TWENTY TWO I HAD JUST GRADUATED FROM HARVARD COLLEGE
tst2013.talkid1654_006 I HAD MOVED TO NEW YORK CITY FOR MY FIRST JOB AS A WRITER AND EDITOR AT SEVENTEEN MAGAZINE
tst2013.talkid1654_007 I HAD MY FIRST APARTMENT MY FIRST LITTLE GREEN AMERICAN EXPRESS CARD AND I HAD A VERY BIG SECRET
tst2013.talkid1654_008 MY SECRET WAS THAT I HAD THIS GUN LOADED WITH HOLLOW POINT BULLETS POINTED AT MY HEAD BY THE MAN WHO I THOUGHT WAS MY SOULMATE MANY MANY TIMES
tst2013.talkid1654_009 THE MAN WHO I LOVED MORE THAN ANYBODY ON EARTH HELD A GUN TO MY HEAD AND THREATENED TO KILL ME MORE TIMES THAN I CAN EVEN REMEMBER
tst2013.talkid1654_010 I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THE STORY OF CRAZY LOVE A PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAP DISGUISED AS LOVE ONE THAT MILLIONS OF WOMEN AND EVEN A FEW MEN FALL INTO EVERY YEAR
tst2013.talkid1654_011 IT MAY EVEN BE YOUR STORY
tst2013.talkid1654_012 I DON'T LOOK LIKE A TYPICAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVOR
tst2013.talkid1654_013 I HAVE A BA IN ENGLISH FROM HARVARD COLLEGE AN MBA IN MARKETING FROM WHARTON BUSINESS SCHOOL
tst2013.talkid1654_014 I'VE SPENT MOST OF MY CAREER WORKING FOR FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES INCLUDING JOHNSON AND JOHNSON LEO BURNETT AND THE WASHINGTON POST
tst2013.talkid1654_015 I'VE BEEN MARRIED FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS TO MY SECOND HUSBAND AND WE HAVE THREE KIDS TOGETHER
tst2013.talkid1654_016 MY DOG IS A BLACK LAB AND I DRIVE A HONDA ODYSSEY MINIVAN
tst2013.talkid1654_017 SO MY FIRST MESSAGE FOR YOU IS THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HAPPENS TO EVERYONE ALL RACES ALL RELIGIONS ALL INCOME AND EDUCATION LEVELS
tst2013.talkid1654_018 IT'S EVERYWHERE
tst2013.talkid1654_019 AND MY SECOND MESSAGE IS THAT EVERYONE THINKS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE HAPPENS TO WOMEN THAT IT'S A WOMEN'S ISSUE
tst2013.talkid1654_020 NOT EXACTLY
tst2013.talkid1654_021 OVER EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF ABUSERS ARE MEN AND DOMESTIC ABUSE HAPPENS ONLY IN INTIMATE INTERDEPENDENT LONG TERM RELATIONSHIPS IN OTHER WORDS IN FAMILIES THE LAST PLACE WE WOULD WANT OR EXPECT TO FIND VIOLENCE WHICH IS ONE REASON DOMESTIC ABUSE IS SO CONFUSING
tst2013.talkid1654_022 I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU MYSELF THAT I WAS THE LAST PERSON ON EARTH WHO WOULD STAY WITH A MAN WHO BEATS ME BUT IN FACT I WAS A VERY TYPICAL VICTIM BECAUSE OF MY AGE
tst2013.talkid1654_023 I WAS TWENTY TWO AND IN THE UNITED STATES WOMEN AGES SIXTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR ARE THREE TIMES AS LIKELY TO BE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIMS AS WOMEN OF OTHER AGES AND OVER FIVE HUNDRED WOMEN AND GIRLS THIS AGE ARE KILLED EVERY YEAR BY ABUSIVE PARTNERS BOYFRIENDS AND HUSBANDS IN THE UNITED STATES
tst2013.talkid1654_024 I WAS ALSO A VERY TYPICAL VICTIM BECAUSE I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ITS WARNING SIGNS OR ITS PATTERNS
tst2013.talkid1654_025 I MET CONOR ON A COLD RAINY JANUARY NIGHT
tst2013.talkid1654_026 HE SAT NEXT TO ME ON THE NEW YORK CITY SUBWAY AND HE STARTED CHATTING ME UP
tst2013.talkid1654_027 HE TOLD ME TWO THINGS
tst2013.talkid1654_028 ONE WAS THAT HE TOO HAD JUST GRADUATED FROM AN IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL AND THAT HE WORKED AT A VERY IMPRESSIVE WALL STREET BANK
tst2013.talkid1654_029 BUT WHAT MADE THE BIGGEST IMPRESSION ON ME THAT FIRST MEETING WAS THAT HE WAS SMART AND FUNNY AND HE LOOKED LIKE A FARM BOY
tst2013.talkid1654_030 HE HAD THESE BIG CHEEKS THESE BIG APPLE CHEEKS AND THIS WHEAT BLOND HAIR AND HE SEEMED SO SWEET
tst2013.talkid1654_031 ONE OF THE SMARTEST THINGS CONOR DID FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WAS TO CREATE THE ILLUSION THAT I WAS THE DOMINANT PARTNER IN THE RELATIONSHIP
tst2013.talkid1654_032 HE DID THIS ESPECIALLY AT THE BEGINNING BY IDOLIZING ME
tst2013.talkid1654_033 WE STARTED DATING AND HE LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT ME THAT I WAS SMART THAT I'D GONE TO HARVARD THAT I WAS PASSIONATE ABOUT HELPING TEENAGE GIRLS AND MY JOB
tst2013.talkid1654_034 HE WANTED TO KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT MY FAMILY AND MY CHILDHOOD AND MY HOPES AND DREAMS
tst2013.talkid1654_035 CONOR BELIEVED IN ME AS A WRITER AND A WOMAN IN A WAY THAT NO ONE ELSE EVER HAD
tst2013.talkid1654_036 AND HE ALSO CREATED A MAGICAL ATMOSPHERE OF TRUST BETWEEN US BY CONFESSING HIS SECRET WHICH WAS THAT AS A VERY YOUNG BOY STARTING AT AGE FOUR HE HAD BEEN SAVAGELY AND REPEATEDLY PHYSICALLY ABUSED BY HIS STEPFATHER AND THE ABUSE HAD GOTTEN SO BAD THAT HE HAD HAD TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL IN EIGHTH GRADE EVEN THOUGH HE WAS VERY SMART AND HE'D SPENT ALMOST TWENTY YEARS REBUILDING HIS LIFE
tst2013.talkid1654_037 WHICH IS WHY THAT IVY LEAGUE DEGREE AND THE WALL STREET JOB AND HIS BRIGHT SHINY FUTURE MEANT SO MUCH TO HIM
tst2013.talkid1654_038 IF YOU HAD TOLD ME THAT THIS SMART FUNNY SENSITIVE MAN WHO ADORED ME WOULD ONE DAY DICTATE WHETHER OR NOT I WORE MAKEUP HOW SHORT MY SKIRTS WERE WHERE I LIVED WHAT JOBS I TOOK WHO MY FRIENDS WERE AND WHERE I SPENT CHRISTMAS I WOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT YOU BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT A HINT OF VIOLENCE OR CONTROL OR ANGER IN CONOR AT THE BEGINNING
tst2013.talkid1654_039 I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE FIRST STAGE IN ANY DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RELATIONSHIP IS TO SEDUCE AND CHARM THE VICTIM
tst2013.talkid1654_040 I ALSO DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE SECOND STEP IS TO ISOLATE THE VICTIM
tst2013.talkid1654_041 NOW CONOR DID NOT COME HOME ONE DAY AND ANNOUNCE YOU KNOW HEY ALL THIS ROMEO AND JULIET STUFF HAS BEEN GREAT BUT I NEED TO MOVE INTO THE NEXT PHASE WHERE I ISOLATE YOU AND I ABUSE YOU SO I NEED TO GET YOU OUT OF THIS APARTMENT WHERE THE NEIGHBORS CAN HEAR YOU SCREAM AND OUT OF THIS CITY WHERE YOU HAVE FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND COWORKERS WHO CAN SEE THE BRUISES
tst2013.talkid1654_042 INSTEAD CONOR CAME HOME ONE FRIDAY EVENING AND HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD QUIT HIS JOB THAT DAY HIS DREAM JOB AND HE SAID THAT HE HAD QUIT HIS JOB BECAUSE OF ME BECAUSE I HAD MADE HIM FEEL SO SAFE AND LOVED THAT HE DIDN'T NEED TO PROVE HIMSELF ON WALL STREET ANYMORE AND HE JUST WANTED TO GET OUT OF THE CITY AND AWAY FROM HIS ABUSIVE DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY AND MOVE TO A TINY TOWN IN NEW ENGLAND WHERE HE COULD START HIS LIFE OVER WITH ME BY HIS SIDE
tst2013.talkid1654_043 NOW THE LAST THING I WANTED TO DO WAS LEAVE NEW YORK AND MY DREAM JOB BUT I THOUGHT YOU MADE SACRIFICES FOR YOUR SOULMATE SO I AGREED AND I QUIT MY JOB AND CONOR AND I LEFT MANHATTAN TOGETHER
tst2013.talkid1654_044 I HAD NO IDEA I WAS FALLING INTO CRAZY LOVE THAT I WAS WALKING HEADFIRST INTO A CAREFULLY LAID PHYSICAL FINANCIAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAP
tst2013.talkid1654_045 THE NEXT STEP IN THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PATTERN IS TO INTRODUCE THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE AND SEE HOW SHE REACTS
tst2013.talkid1654_046 AND HERE'S WHERE THOSE GUNS COME IN
tst2013.talkid1654_047 AS SOON AS WE MOVED TO NEW ENGLAND YOU KNOW THAT PLACE WHERE CONNOR WAS SUPPOSED TO FEEL SO SAFE HE BOUGHT THREE GUNS
tst2013.talkid1654_048 HE KEPT ONE IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT OF OUR CAR
tst2013.talkid1654_049 HE KEPT ONE UNDER THE PILLOWS ON OUR BED AND THE THIRD ONE HE KEPT IN HIS POCKET AT ALL TIMES
tst2013.talkid1654_050 AND HE SAID THAT HE NEEDED THOSE GUNS BECAUSE OF THE TRAUMA HE'D EXPERIENCED AS A YOUNG BOY
tst2013.talkid1654_051 HE NEEDED THEM TO FEEL PROTECTED
tst2013.talkid1654_052 BUT THOSE GUNS WERE REALLY A MESSAGE FOR ME AND EVEN THOUGH HE HADN'T RAISED A HAND TO ME MY LIFE WAS ALREADY IN GRAVE DANGER EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY
tst2013.talkid1654_053 CONOR FIRST PHYSICALLY ATTACKED ME FIVE DAYS BEFORE OUR WEDDING
tst2013.talkid1654_054 IT WAS SEVEN AM I STILL HAD ON MY NIGHTGOWN
tst2013.talkid1654_055 I WAS WORKING ON MY COMPUTER TRYING TO FINISH A FREELANCE WRITING ASSIGNMENT AND I GOT FRUSTRATED AND CONOR USED MY ANGER AS AN EXCUSE TO PUT BOTH OF HIS HANDS AROUND MY NECK AND TO SQUEEZE SO TIGHTLY THAT I COULD NOT BREATHE OR SCREAM AND HE USED THE CHOKEHOLD TO HIT MY HEAD REPEATEDLY AGAINST THE WALL
tst2013.talkid1654_056 FIVE DAYS LATER THE TEN BRUISES ON MY NECK HAD JUST FADED AND I PUT ON MY MOTHER'S WEDDING DRESS AND I MARRIED HIM
tst2013.talkid1654_057 DESPITE WHAT HAD HAPPENED I WAS SURE WE WERE GOING TO LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER BECAUSE I LOVED HIM AND HE LOVED ME SO MUCH
tst2013.talkid1654_058 AND HE WAS VERY VERY SORRY
tst2013.talkid1654_059 HE HAD JUST BEEN REALLY STRESSED OUT BY THE WEDDING AND BY BECOMING A FAMILY WITH ME
tst2013.talkid1654_060 IT WAS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT AND HE WAS NEVER GOING TO HURT ME AGAIN
tst2013.talkid1654_061 IT HAPPENED TWICE MORE ON THE HONEYMOON
tst2013.talkid1654_062 THE FIRST TIME I WAS DRIVING TO FIND A SECRET BEACH AND I GOT LOST AND HE PUNCHED ME IN THE SIDE OF MY HEAD SO HARD THAT THE OTHER SIDE OF MY HEAD REPEATEDLY HIT THE DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW
tst2013.talkid1654_063 AND THEN A FEW DAYS LATER DRIVING HOME FROM OUR HONEYMOON HE GOT FRUSTRATED BY TRAFFIC AND HE THREW A COLD BIG MAC IN MY FACE
tst2013.talkid1654_064 CONOR PROCEEDED TO BEAT ME ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK FOR THE NEXT TWO AND A HALF YEARS OF OUR MARRIAGE
tst2013.talkid1654_065 I WAS MISTAKEN IN THINKING THAT I WAS UNIQUE AND ALONE IN THIS SITUATION
tst2013.talkid1654_066 ONE IN THREE AMERICAN WOMEN EXPERIENCES DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OR STALKING AT SOME POINT IN HER LIFE AND THE CDC REPORTS THAT FIFTEEN MILLION CHILDREN ARE ABUSED EVERY YEAR FIFTEEN MILLION
tst2013.talkid1654_067 SO ACTUALLY I WAS IN VERY GOOD COMPANY
tst2013.talkid1654_068 BACK TO MY QUESTION WHY DID I STAY
tst2013.talkid1654_069 THE ANSWER IS EASY
tst2013.talkid1654_070 I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS ABUSING ME
tst2013.talkid1654_071 EVEN THOUGH HE HELD THOSE LOADED GUNS TO MY HEAD PUSHED ME DOWN STAIRS THREATENED TO KILL OUR DOG PULLED THE KEY OUT OF THE CAR IGNITION AS I DROVE DOWN THE HIGHWAY POURED COFFEE GRINDS ON MY HEAD AS I DRESSED FOR A JOB INTERVIEW I NEVER ONCE THOUGHT OF MYSELF AS A BATTERED WIFE
tst2013.talkid1654_072 INSTEAD I WAS A VERY STRONG WOMAN IN LOVE WITH A DEEPLY TROUBLED MAN AND I WAS THE ONLY PERSON ON EARTH WHO COULD HELP CONOR FACE HIS DEMONS
tst2013.talkid1654_073 THE OTHER QUESTION EVERYBODY ASKS IS WHY DOESN'T SHE JUST LEAVE
tst2013.talkid1654_074 WHY DIDN'T I WALK OUT I COULD HAVE LEFT ANY TIME
tst2013.talkid1654_075 TO ME THIS IS THE SADDEST AND MOST PAINFUL QUESTION THAT PEOPLE ASK BECAUSE WE VICTIMS KNOW SOMETHING YOU USUALLY DON'T IT'S INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS TO LEAVE AN ABUSER
tst2013.talkid1654_076 BECAUSE THE FINAL STEP IN THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PATTERN IS KILL HER
tst2013.talkid1654_077 OVER SEVENTY PERCENT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MURDERS HAPPEN AFTER THE VICTIM HAS ENDED THE RELATIONSHIP AFTER SHE'S GOTTEN OUT BECAUSE THEN THE ABUSER HAS NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE
tst2013.talkid1654_078 OTHER OUTCOMES INCLUDE LONG TERM STALKING EVEN AFTER THE ABUSER REMARRIES DENIAL OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND MANIPULATION OF THE FAMILY COURT SYSTEM TO TERRIFY THE VICTIM AND HER CHILDREN WHO ARE REGULARLY FORCED BY FAMILY COURT JUDGES TO SPEND UNSUPERVISED TIME WITH THE MAN WHO BEAT THEIR MOTHER
tst2013.talkid1654_079 AND STILL WE ASK WHY DOESN'T SHE JUST LEAVE
tst2013.talkid1654_080 I WAS ABLE TO LEAVE BECAUSE OF ONE FINAL SADISTIC BEATING THAT BROKE THROUGH MY DENIAL
tst2013.talkid1654_081 I REALIZED THAT THE MAN WHO I LOVED SO MUCH WAS GOING TO KILL ME IF I LET HIM
tst2013.talkid1654_082 SO I BROKE THE SILENCE
tst2013.talkid1654_083 I TOLD EVERYONE THE POLICE MY NEIGHBORS MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY TOTAL STRANGERS AND I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE YOU ALL HELPED ME
tst2013.talkid1654_084 WE TEND TO STEREOTYPE VICTIMS AS GRISLY HEADLINES SELF DESTRUCTIVE WOMEN DAMAGED GOODS
tst2013.talkid1654_085 THE QUESTION WHY DOES SHE STAY
tst2013.talkid1654_086 IS CODE FOR SOME PEOPLE FOR IT'S HER FAULT FOR STAYING AS IF VICTIMS INTENTIONALLY CHOOSE TO FALL IN LOVE WITH MEN INTENT UPON DESTROYING US
tst2013.talkid1654_087 BUT SINCE PUBLISHING CRAZY LOVE I HAVE HEARD HUNDREDS OF STORIES FROM MEN AND WOMEN WHO ALSO GOT OUT WHO LEARNED AN INVALUABLE LIFE LESSON FROM WHAT HAPPENED AND WHO REBUILT LIVES JOYOUS HAPPY LIVES AS EMPLOYEES WIVES AND MOTHERS LIVES COMPLETELY FREE OF VIOLENCE LIKE ME
tst2013.talkid1654_088 BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THAT I'M ACTUALLY A VERY TYPICAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM AND A TYPICAL DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVOR
tst2013.talkid1654_089 I REMARRIED A KIND AND GENTLE MAN AND WE HAVE THOSE THREE KIDS
tst2013.talkid1654_090 I HAVE THAT BLACK LAB AND I HAVE THAT MINIVAN
tst2013.talkid1654_091 WHAT I WILL NEVER HAVE AGAIN EVER IS A LOADED GUN HELD TO MY HEAD BY SOMEONE WHO SAYS THAT HE LOVES ME
tst2013.talkid1654_092 RIGHT NOW MAYBE YOU'RE THINKING WOW THIS IS FASCINATING OR WOW HOW STUPID WAS SHE BUT THIS WHOLE TIME I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN TALKING ABOUT YOU
tst2013.talkid1654_093 I PROMISE YOU THERE ARE SEVERAL PEOPLE LISTENING TO ME RIGHT NOW WHO ARE CURRENTLY BEING ABUSED OR WHO WERE ABUSED AS CHILDREN OR WHO ARE ABUSERS THEMSELVES
tst2013.talkid1654_094 ABUSE COULD BE AFFECTING YOUR DAUGHTER YOUR SISTER YOUR BEST FRIEND RIGHT NOW
tst2013.talkid1654_095 I WAS ABLE TO END MY OWN CRAZY LOVE STORY BY BREAKING THE SILENCE
tst2013.talkid1654_096 I'M STILL BREAKING THE SILENCE TODAY
tst2013.talkid1654_097 IT'S MY WAY OF HELPING OTHER VICTIMS AND IT'S MY FINAL REQUEST OF YOU
tst2013.talkid1654_098 TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU HEARD HERE
tst2013.talkid1654_099 ABUSE THRIVES ONLY IN SILENCE
tst2013.talkid1654_100 YOU HAVE THE POWER TO END DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SIMPLY BY SHINING A SPOTLIGHT ON IT
tst2013.talkid1654_101 WE VICTIMS NEED EVERYONE
tst2013.talkid1654_102 WE NEED EVERY ONE OF YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE SECRETS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
tst2013.talkid1654_103 SHOW ABUSE THE LIGHT OF DAY BY TALKING ABOUT IT WITH YOUR CHILDREN YOUR COWORKERS YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY
tst2013.talkid1654_104 RECAST SURVIVORS AS WONDERFUL LOVABLE PEOPLE WITH FULL FUTURES
tst2013.talkid1654_105 RECOGNIZE THE EARLY SIGNS OF VIOLENCE AND CONSCIENTIOUSLY INTERVENE DEESCALATE IT SHOW VICTIMS A SAFE WAY OUT
tst2013.talkid1654_106 TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE OUR BEDS OUR DINNER TABLES AND OUR FAMILIES THE SAFE AND PEACEFUL OASES THEY SHOULD BE
tst2013.talkid1654_107 THANK YOU
tst2013.talkid1658_000 HUMAN BEINGS START PUTTING EACH OTHER INTO BOXES THE SECOND THAT THEY SEE EACH OTHER IS THAT PERSON DANGEROUS ARE THEY ATTRACTIVE
tst2013.talkid1658_001 ARE THEY A POTENTIAL MATE ARE THEY A POTENTIAL NETWORKING OPPORTUNITY
tst2013.talkid1658_002 WE DO THIS LITTLE INTERROGATION WHEN WE MEET PEOPLE TO MAKE A MENTAL RESUME FOR THEM
tst2013.talkid1658_003 WHAT'S YOUR NAME WHERE ARE YOU FROM
tst2013.talkid1658_004 HOW OLD ARE YOU WHAT DO YOU DO
tst2013.talkid1658_005 THEN WE GET MORE PERSONAL WITH IT
tst2013.talkid1658_006 HAVE YOU EVER HAD ANY DISEASES
tst2013.talkid1658_007 HAVE YOU EVER BEEN DIVORCED
tst2013.talkid1658_008 DOES YOUR BREATH SMELL BAD WHILE YOU'RE ANSWERING MY INTERROGATION RIGHT NOW
tst2013.talkid1658_009 WHAT ARE YOU INTO WHO ARE YOU INTO
tst2013.talkid1658_010 WHAT GENDER DO YOU LIKE TO SLEEP WITH
tst2013.talkid1658_011 I GET IT
tst2013.talkid1658_012 WE ARE NEUROLOGICALLY HARDWIRED TO SEEK OUT PEOPLE LIKE OURSELVES
tst2013.talkid1658_013 WE START FORMING CLIQUES AS SOON AS WE'RE OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT ACCEPTANCE FEELS LIKE
tst2013.talkid1658_014 WE BOND TOGETHER BASED ON ANYTHING THAT WE CAN MUSIC PREFERENCE RACE GENDER THE BLOCK THAT WE GREW UP ON
tst2013.talkid1658_015 WE SEEK OUT ENVIRONMENTS THAT REINFORCE OUR PERSONAL CHOICES
tst2013.talkid1658_016 SOMETIMES THOUGH JUST THE QUESTION WHAT DO YOU DO
tst2013.talkid1658_017 CAN FEEL LIKE SOMEBODY'S OPENING A TINY LITTLE BOX AND ASKING YOU TO SQUEEZE YOURSELF INSIDE OF IT
tst2013.talkid1658_018 BECAUSE THE CATEGORIES I'VE FOUND ARE TOO LIMITING
tst2013.talkid1658_019 THE BOXES ARE TOO NARROW
tst2013.talkid1658_020 AND THIS CAN GET REALLY DANGEROUS
tst2013.talkid1658_021 SO HERE'S A DISCLAIMER ABOUT ME THOUGH BEFORE WE GET TOO DEEP INTO THIS
tst2013.talkid1658_022 I GREW UP IN A VERY SHELTERED ENVIRONMENT
tst2013.talkid1658_023 I WAS RAISED IN DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN IN THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES TWO BLOCKS FROM THE EPICENTER OF PUNK MUSIC
tst2013.talkid1658_024 I WAS SHIELDED FROM THE PAINS OF BIGOTRY AND THE SOCIAL RESTRICTIONS OF A RELIGIOUSLY BASED UPBRINGING
tst2013.talkid1658_025 WHERE I COME FROM IF YOU WEREN'T A DRAG QUEEN OR A RADICAL THINKER OR A PERFORMANCE ARTIST OF SOME KIND YOU WERE THE WEIRDO
tst2013.talkid1658_026 IT WAS AN UNORTHODOX UPBRINGING BUT AS A KID ON THE STREETS OF NEW YORK YOU LEARN HOW TO TRUST YOUR OWN INSTINCTS YOU LEARN HOW TO GO WITH YOUR OWN IDEAS
tst2013.talkid1658_027 SO WHEN I WAS SIX I DECIDED THAT I WANTED TO BE A BOY
tst2013.talkid1658_028 I WENT TO SCHOOL ONE DAY AND THE KIDS WOULDN'T LET ME PLAY BASKETBALL WITH THEM
tst2013.talkid1658_029 THEY SAID THEY WOULDN'T LET GIRLS PLAY
tst2013.talkid1658_030 SO I WENT HOME AND I SHAVED MY HEAD AND I CAME BACK THE NEXT DAY AND I SAID I'M A BOY
tst2013.talkid1658_031 I MEAN WHO KNOWS RIGHT
tst2013.talkid1658_032 WHEN YOU'RE SIX MAYBE YOU CAN DO THAT
tst2013.talkid1658_033 I DIDN'T WANT ANYONE TO KNOW THAT I WAS A GIRL AND THEY DIDN'T
tst2013.talkid1658_034 I KEPT UP THE CHARADE FOR EIGHT YEARS
tst2013.talkid1658_035 SO THIS IS ME WHEN I WAS ELEVEN
tst2013.talkid1658_036 I WAS PLAYING A KID NAMED WALTER IN A MOVIE CALLED JULIAN PO
tst2013.talkid1658_037 I WAS A LITTLE STREET TOUGH THAT FOLLOWED CHRISTIAN SLATER AROUND AND BADGERED HIM
tst2013.talkid1658_038 SEE I WAS ALSO A CHILD ACTOR WHICH DOUBLED UP THE LAYERS OF THE PERFORMANCE OF MY IDENTITY BECAUSE NO ONE KNEW THAT I WAS ACTUALLY A GIRL REALLY PLAYING A BOY
tst2013.talkid1658_039 IN FACT NO ONE IN MY LIFE KNEW THAT I WAS A GIRL NOT MY TEACHERS AT SCHOOL NOT MY FRIENDS NOT THE DIRECTORS THAT I WORKED WITH
tst2013.talkid1658_040 KIDS WOULD OFTEN COME UP TO ME IN CLASS AND GRAB ME BY THE THROAT TO CHECK FOR AN ADAM'S APPLE OR GRAB MY MY CROTCH TO CHECK WHAT I WAS WORKING WITH
tst2013.talkid1658_041 WHEN I WOULD GO TO THE BATHROOM I WOULD TURN MY SHOES AROUND IN THE STALLS SO THAT IT LOOKED LIKE I WAS PEEING STANDING UP
tst2013.talkid1658_042 AT SLEEPOVERS I WOULD HAVE PANIC ATTACKS TRYING TO BREAK IT TO GIRLS THAT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO KISS ME WITHOUT OUTING MYSELF
tst2013.talkid1658_043 IT'S WORTH MENTIONING THOUGH THAT I DIDN'T HATE MY BODY OR MY GENITALIA
tst2013.talkid1658_044 I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE I WAS IN THE WRONG BODY
tst2013.talkid1658_045 I FELT LIKE I WAS PERFORMING THIS ELABORATE ACT
tst2013.talkid1658_046 I WOULDN'T HAVE QUALIFIED AS TRANSGENDER
tst2013.talkid1658_047 IF MY FAMILY THOUGH HAD BEEN THE KIND OF PEOPLE TO BELIEVE IN THERAPY THEY PROBABLY WOULD HAVE DIAGNOSED ME AS SOMETHING LIKE GENDER DYSMORPHIC AND PUT ME ON HORMONES TO STAVE OFF PUBERTY
tst2013.talkid1658_048 BUT IN MY PARTICULAR CASE I JUST WOKE UP ONE DAY WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN AND I DECIDED THAT I WANTED TO BE A GIRL AGAIN
tst2013.talkid1658_049 PUBERTY HAD HIT AND I HAD NO IDEA WHAT BEING A GIRL MEANT AND I WAS READY READY TO FIGURE OUT WHO I ACTUALLY WAS
tst2013.talkid1658_050 WHEN A KID BEHAVES LIKE I DID THEY DON'T EXACTLY HAVE TO COME OUT RIGHT
tst2013.talkid1658_051 NO ONE IS EXACTLY SHOCKED
tst2013.talkid1658_052 BUT I WASN'T ASKED TO DEFINE MYSELF BY MY PARENTS
tst2013.talkid1658_053 WHEN I WAS FIFTEEN AND I CALLED MY FATHER TO TELL HIM THAT I HAD FALLEN IN LOVE IT WAS THE LAST THING ON EITHER OF OUR MINDS TO DISCUSS WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES WERE OF THE FACT THAT MY FIRST LOVE WAS A GIRL
tst2013.talkid1658_054 THREE YEARS LATER WHEN I FELL IN LOVE WITH A MAN NEITHER OF MY PARENTS BATTED AN EYELASH EITHER
tst2013.talkid1658_055 SEE IT'S ONE OF THE GREAT BLESSINGS OF MY VERY UNORTHODOX CHILDHOOD THAT I WASN'T EVER ASKED TO DEFINE MYSELF AS ANY ONE THING AT ANY POINT
tst2013.talkid1658_056 I WAS JUST ALLOWED TO BE ME GROWING AND CHANGING IN EVERY MOMENT
tst2013.talkid1658_057 SO FOUR ALMOST FIVE YEARS AGO PROPOSITION EIGHT THE GREAT MARRIAGE EQUALITY DEBATE WAS RAISING A LOT OF DUST AROUND THIS COUNTRY
tst2013.talkid1658_058 AND AT THE TIME GETTING MARRIED WASN'T REALLY SOMETHING I SPENT A LOT OF TIME THINKING ABOUT
tst2013.talkid1658_059 BUT I WAS STRUCK BY THE FACT THAT AMERICA A COUNTRY WITH SUCH A TARNISHED CIVIL RIGHTS RECORD COULD BE REPEATING ITS MISTAKES SO BLATANTLY
tst2013.talkid1658_060 AND I REMEMBER WATCHING THE DISCUSSION ON TELEVISION AND THINKING HOW INTERESTING IT WAS THAT THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE WAS ESSENTIALLY DRAWING GEOGRAPHICAL BOUNDARIES THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY BETWEEN PLACES WHERE PEOPLE BELIEVED IN IT AND PLACES WHERE PEOPLE DIDN'T
tst2013.talkid1658_061 AND THEN THAT THIS DISCUSSION WAS DRAWING GEOGRAPHICAL BOUNDARIES AROUND ME
tst2013.talkid1658_062 IF THIS WAS A WAR WITH TWO DISPARATE SIDES I BY DEFAULT FELL ON TEAM GAY BECAUSE I CERTAINLY WASN'T A HUNDRED PERCENT STRAIGHT
tst2013.talkid1658_063 AT THE TIME I WAS JUST BEGINNING TO EMERGE FROM THIS EIGHT YEAR PERSONAL IDENTITY CRISIS ZIGZAG THAT SAW ME GO FROM BEING A BOY TO BEING THIS AWKWARD GIRL THAT LOOKED LIKE A BOY IN GIRL'S CLOTHES TO THE OPPOSITE EXTREME OF THIS SUPER SKIMPY OVER COMPENSATING BOY CHASING GIRLY GIRL TO FINALLY JUST A HESITANT EXPLORATION OF WHAT I ACTUALLY WAS A TOMBOYISH GIRL WHO LIKED BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS DEPENDING ON THE PERSON
tst2013.talkid1658_064 I HAD SPENT A YEAR PHOTOGRAPHING THIS NEW GENERATION OF GIRLS MUCH LIKE MYSELF WHO FELL KIND OF BETWEEN THE LINES GIRLS WHO SKATEBOARDED BUT DID IT IN LACY UNDERWEAR GIRLS WHO HAD BOYS' HAIRCUTS BUT WORE GIRLY NAIL POLISH GIRLS WHO HAD EYESHADOW TO MATCH THEIR SCRAPED KNEES GIRLS WHO LIKED GIRLS AND BOYS WHO ALL LIKED BOYS AND GIRLS WHO ALL HATED BEING BOXED IN TO ANYTHING
tst2013.talkid1658_065 I LOVED THESE PEOPLE AND I ADMIRED THEIR FREEDOM BUT I WATCHED AS THE WORLD OUTSIDE OF OUR UTOPIAN BUBBLE EXPLODED INTO THESE RAGING DEBATES WHERE PUNDITS STARTED LIKENING OUR LOVE TO BESTIALITY ON NATIONAL TELEVISION
tst2013.talkid1658_066 AND THIS POWERFUL AWARENESS ROLLED IN OVER ME THAT I WAS A MINORITY AND IN MY OWN HOME COUNTRY BASED ON ONE FACET OF MY CHARACTER
tst2013.talkid1658_067 I WAS LEGALLY AND INDISPUTABLY A SECOND CLASS CITIZEN
tst2013.talkid1658_068 I WAS NOT AN ACTIVIST
tst2013.talkid1658_069 I WAVE NO FLAGS IN MY OWN LIFE
tst2013.talkid1658_070 BUT I WAS PLAGUED BY THIS QUESTION HOW COULD ANYONE VOTE TO STRIP THE RIGHTS OF THE VAST VARIETY OF PEOPLE THAT I KNEW BASED ON ONE ELEMENT OF THEIR CHARACTER
tst2013.talkid1658_071 HOW COULD THEY SAY THAT WE AS A GROUP WERE NOT DESERVING OF EQUAL RIGHTS AS SOMEBODY ELSE
tst2013.talkid1658_072 WERE WE EVEN A GROUP WHAT GROUP
tst2013.talkid1658_073 AND HAD THESE PEOPLE EVER EVEN CONSCIOUSLY MET A VICTIM OF THEIR DISCRIMINATION
tst2013.talkid1658_074 DID THEY KNOW WHO THEY WERE VOTING AGAINST AND WHAT THE IMPACT WAS
tst2013.talkid1658_075 AND THEN IT OCCURRED TO ME PERHAPS IF THEY COULD LOOK INTO THE EYES OF THE PEOPLE THAT THEY WERE CASTING INTO SECOND CLASS CITIZENSHIP IT MIGHT MAKE IT HARDER FOR THEM TO DO
tst2013.talkid1658_076 IT MIGHT GIVE THEM PAUSE
tst2013.talkid1658_077 OBVIOUSLY I COULDN'T GET TWENTY MILLION PEOPLE TO THE SAME DINNER PARTY SO I FIGURED OUT A WAY WHERE I COULD INTRODUCE THEM TO EACH OTHER PHOTOGRAPHICALLY WITHOUT ANY ARTIFICE WITHOUT ANY LIGHTING OR WITHOUT ANY MANIPULATION OF ANY KIND ON MY PART
tst2013.talkid1658_078 BECAUSE IN A PHOTOGRAPH YOU CAN EXAMINE A LION'S WHISKERS WITHOUT HIM THE FEAR OF HIM RIPPING YOUR FACE OFF
tst2013.talkid1658_079 FOR ME PHOTOGRAPHY IS NOT JUST ABOUT EXPOSING FILM IT'S ABOUT EXPOSING THE VIEWER TO SOMETHING NEW A PLACE THEY HAVEN'T GONE BEFORE BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY TO PEOPLE THAT THEY MIGHT BE AFRAID OF
tst2013.talkid1658_080 LIFE MAGAZINE INTRODUCED GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE TO DISTANT FAR OFF CULTURES THEY NEVER KNEW EXISTED THROUGH PICTURES
tst2013.talkid1658_081 SO I DECIDED TO MAKE A SERIES OF VERY SIMPLE PORTRAITS MUGSHOTS IF YOU WILL
tst2013.talkid1658_082 AND I BASICALLY DECIDED TO PHOTOGRAPH ANYONE IN THIS COUNTRY THAT WAS NOT ONE HUNDRED PERCENT STRAIGHT WHICH IF YOU DON'T KNOW IS A LIMITLESS NUMBER OF PEOPLE
tst2013.talkid1658_083 SO THIS WAS A VERY LARGE UNDERTAKING AND TO DO IT WE NEEDED SOME HELP
tst2013.talkid1658_084 SO I RAN OUT IN THE FREEZING COLD AND I PHOTOGRAPHED EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT I KNEW THAT I COULD GET TO IN FEBRUARY OF ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO
tst2013.talkid1658_085 AND I TOOK THOSE PHOTOGRAPHS AND I WENT TO THE HRC AND I ASKED THEM FOR SOME HELP
tst2013.talkid1658_086 AND THEY FUNDED TWO WEEKS OF SHOOTING IN NEW YORK
tst2013.talkid1658_087 AND THEN WE MADE THIS
tst2013.talkid1658_088 I'M IO TILLETT WRIGHT AND I'M AN ARTIST BORN AND RAISED IN NEW YORK CITY
tst2013.talkid1658_089 SELF EVIDENT TRUTHS IS A PHOTOGRAPHIC RECORD OF LGBTQ AMERICA TODAY
tst2013.talkid1658_090 MY AIM IS TO TAKE A SIMPLE PORTRAIT OF ANYONE WHO'S ANYTHING OTHER THAN ONE HUNDRED PERCENT STRAIGHT OR FEELS LIKE THEY FALL IN THE LGBTQ SPECTRUM IN ANY WAY
tst2013.talkid1658_091 MY GOAL IS TO SHOW THE HUMANITY THAT EXISTS IN EVERY ONE OF US THROUGH THE SIMPLICITY OF A FACE
tst2013.talkid1658_092 WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF EVIDENT THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL
tst2013.talkid1658_093 IT'S WRITTEN IN THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
tst2013.talkid1658_094 WE ARE FAILING AS A NATION TO UPHOLD THE MORALS UPON WHICH WE WERE FOUNDED
tst2013.talkid1658_095 THERE IS NO EQUALITY IN THE UNITED STATES
tst2013.talkid1658_096 IT'S WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IT SIMPLE AS THAT
tst2013.talkid1658_097 THE FIGHT FOR EQUAL RIGHTS IS NOT JUST ABOUT GAY MARRIAGE
tst2013.talkid1658_098 TODAY IN TWENTY NINE STATES MORE THAN HALF OF THIS COUNTRY YOU CAN LEGALLY BE FIRED JUST FOR YOUR SEXUALITY
tst2013.talkid1658_099 I'VE HEARD HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE GIVE THE SAME ANSWER WE ARE ALL RESPONSIBLE FOR EQUALITY
tst2013.talkid1658_100 SO FAR WE'VE SHOT THREE HUNDRED FACES IN NEW YORK CITY
tst2013.talkid1658_101 AND WE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO ANY OF IT WITHOUT THE GENEROUS SUPPORT OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN
tst2013.talkid1658_102 I WANT TO TAKE THE PROJECT ACROSS THE COUNTRY
tst2013.talkid1658_103 I WANT TO VISIT TWENTY FIVE AMERICAN CITIES AND I WANT TO SHOOT FOUR OR FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE
tst2013.talkid1658_104 THIS IS MY CONTRIBUTION TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS FIGHT OF MY GENERATION
tst2013.talkid1658_105 I CHALLENGE YOU TO LOOK INTO THE FACES OF THESE PEOPLE AND TELL THEM THAT THEY DESERVE LESS THAN ANY OTHER HUMAN BEING
tst2013.talkid1658_106 ABSOLUTELY NOTHING COULD HAVE PREPARED US FOR WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT
tst2013.talkid1658_107 ALMOST EIGHTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE WATCHED THAT VIDEO AND THEN THEY STARTED EMAILING US FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY ASKING US TO COME TO THEIR TOWNS AND HELP US TO HELP THEM TO SHOW THEIR FACES
tst2013.talkid1658_108 AND A LOT MORE PEOPLE WANTED TO SHOW THEIR FACES THAN I HAD ANTICIPATED
tst2013.talkid1658_109 SO I CHANGED MY IMMEDIATE GOAL TO TEN THOUSAND FACES
tst2013.talkid1658_110 THAT VIDEO WAS MADE IN THE SPRING OF TWO THOUSAND AND ELEVEN AND AS OF TODAY I HAVE TRAVELED TO ALMOST TWENTY CITIES AND PHOTOGRAPHED ALMOST TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE
tst2013.talkid1658_111 I KNOW THAT THIS IS A TALK BUT I'D LIKE TO HAVE A MINUTE OF JUST QUIET AND HAVE YOU JUST LOOK AT THESE FACES BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING THAT I CAN SAY THAT WILL ADD TO THEM
tst2013.talkid1658_112 BECAUSE IF A PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS THEN A PICTURE OF A FACE NEEDS A WHOLE NEW VOCABULARY
tst2013.talkid1658_113 SO AFTER TRAVELING AND TALKING TO PEOPLE IN PLACES LIKE OKLAHOMA OR SMALL TOWN TEXAS WE FOUND EVIDENCE THAT THE INITIAL PREMISE WAS DEAD ON
tst2013.talkid1658_114 VISIBILITY REALLY IS KEY
tst2013.talkid1658_115 FAMILIARITY REALLY IS THE GATEWAY DRUG TO EMPATHY
tst2013.talkid1658_116 ONCE AN ISSUE POPS UP IN YOUR OWN BACKYARD OR AMONGST YOUR OWN FAMILY YOU'RE FAR MORE LIKELY TO EXPLORE SYMPATHY FOR IT OR EXPLORE A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON IT
tst2013.talkid1658_117 OF COURSE IN MY TRAVELS I MET PEOPLE WHO LEGALLY DIVORCED THEIR CHILDREN FOR BEING OTHER THAN STRAIGHT BUT I ALSO MET PEOPLE WHO WERE SOUTHERN BAPTISTS WHO SWITCHED CHURCHES BECAUSE THEIR CHILD WAS A LESBIAN
tst2013.talkid1658_118 SPARKING EMPATHY HAD BECOME THE BACKBONE OF SELF EVIDENT TRUTHS
tst2013.talkid1658_119 BUT HERE'S WHAT I WAS STARTING TO LEARN THAT WAS REALLY INTERESTING SELF EVIDENT TRUTHS DOESN'T ERASE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN US
tst2013.talkid1658_120 IN FACT ON THE CONTRARY IT HIGHLIGHTS THEM
tst2013.talkid1658_121 IT PRESENTS NOT JUST THE COMPLEXITIES FOUND IN A PROCESSION OF DIFFERENT HUMAN BEINGS BUT THE COMPLEXITIES FOUND WITHIN EACH INDIVIDUAL PERSON
tst2013.talkid1658_122 IT WASN'T THAT WE HAD TOO MANY BOXES IT WAS THAT WE HAD TOO FEW
tst2013.talkid1658_123 AT SOME POINT I REALIZED THAT MY MISSION TO PHOTOGRAPH GAYS WAS INHERENTLY FLAWED BECAUSE THERE WERE A MILLION DIFFERENT SHADES OF GAY
tst2013.talkid1658_124 HERE I WAS TRYING TO HELP AND I HAD PERPETUATED THE VERY THING I HAD SPENT MY LIFE TRYING TO AVOID YET ANOTHER BOX
tst2013.talkid1658_125 AT SOME POINT I ADDED A QUESTION TO THE RELEASE FORM THAT ASKED PEOPLE TO QUANTIFY THEMSELVES ON A SCALE OF ONE TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT GAY
tst2013.talkid1658_126 AND I WATCHED SO MANY EXISTENTIAL CRISES UNFOLD IN FRONT OF ME
tst2013.talkid1658_127 PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO BECAUSE THEY HAD NEVER BEEN PRESENTED WITH THE OPTION BEFORE
tst2013.talkid1658_128 CAN YOU QUANTIFY YOUR OPENNESS
tst2013.talkid1658_129 ONCE THEY GOT OVER THE SHOCK THOUGH BY AND LARGE PEOPLE OPTED FOR SOMEWHERE BETWEEN SEVENTY TO NINETY FIVE PERCENT OR THE THREE TO TWENTY PERCENT MARKS
tst2013.talkid1658_130 OF COURSE THERE WERE LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO OPTED FOR A ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ONE OR THE OTHER BUT I FOUND THAT A MUCH LARGER PROPORTION OF PEOPLE IDENTIFIED AS SOMETHING THAT WAS MUCH MORE NUANCED
tst2013.talkid1658_131 I FOUND THAT MOST PEOPLE FALL ON A SPECTRUM OF WHAT I HAVE COME TO REFER TO AS GREY
tst2013.talkid1658_132 LET ME BE CLEAR THOUGH AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT IN NO WAY AM I SAYING THAT PREFERENCE DOESN'T EXIST
tst2013.talkid1658_133 AND I AM NOT EVEN GOING TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF CHOICE VERSUS BIOLOGICAL IMPERATIVE BECAUSE IF ANY OF YOU HAPPEN TO BE OF THE BELIEF THAT SEXUAL ORIENTATION IS A CHOICE I INVITE YOU TO GO OUT AND TRY TO BE GREY
tst2013.talkid1658_134 I'LL TAKE YOUR PICTURE JUST FOR TRYING
tst2013.talkid1658_135 WHAT I AM SAYING THOUGH IS THAT HUMAN BEINGS ARE NOT ONE DIMENSIONAL
tst2013.talkid1658_136 THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO TAKE FROM THE PERCENTAGE SYSTEM IS THIS IF YOU HAVE GAY PEOPLE OVER HERE AND YOU HAVE STRAIGHT PEOPLE OVER HERE AND WHILE WE RECOGNIZE THAT MOST PEOPLE IDENTIFY AS SOMEWHERE CLOSER TO ONE BINARY OR ANOTHER THERE IS THIS VAST SPECTRUM OF PEOPLE THAT EXIST IN BETWEEN
tst2013.talkid1658_137 AND THE REALITY THAT THIS PRESENTS IS A COMPLICATED ONE
tst2013.talkid1658_138 BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU PASS A LAW THAT ALLOWS A BOSS TO FIRE AN EMPLOYEE FOR HOMOSEXUAL BEHAVIOR WHERE EXACTLY DO YOU DRAW THE LINE
tst2013.talkid1658_139 IS IT OVER HERE BY THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD ONE OR TWO HETEROSEXUAL EXPERIENCES SO FAR
tst2013.talkid1658_140 OR IS IT OVER HERE BY THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ONLY HAD ONE OR TWO HOMOSEXUAL EXPERIENCES THUS FAR
tst2013.talkid1658_141 WHERE EXACTLY DOES ONE BECOME A SECOND CLASS CITIZEN
tst2013.talkid1658_142 ANOTHER INTERESTING THING THAT I LEARNED FROM MY PROJECT AND MY TRAVELS IS JUST WHAT A POOR BINDING AGENT SEXUAL ORIENTATION IS
tst2013.talkid1658_143 AFTER TRAVELING SO MUCH AND MEETING SO MANY PEOPLE LET ME TELL YOU THERE ARE JUST AS MANY JERKS AND SWEETHEARTS AND DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS AND JOCKS AND QUEENS AND EVERY OTHER POLARIZATION YOU CAN POSSIBLY THINK OF WITHIN THE LGBT COMMUNITY AS THERE ARE WITHIN THE HUMAN RACE
tst2013.talkid1658_144 ASIDE FROM THE FACT THAT WE PLAY WITH ONE LEGAL HAND TIED BEHIND OUR BACKS AND ONCE YOU GET PAST THE SHARED NARRATIVE OF PREJUDICE AND STRUGGLE JUST BEING OTHER THAN STRAIGHT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT WE HAVE ANYTHING IN COMMON
tst2013.talkid1658_145 SO IN THE ENDLESS PROLIFERATION OF FACES THAT SELF EVIDENT TRUTHS IS ALWAYS BECOMING AS IT HOPEFULLY APPEARS ACROSS MORE AND MORE PLATFORMS BUS SHELTERS BILLBOARDS FACEBOOK PAGES SCREEN SAVERS PERHAPS IN WATCHING THIS PROCESSION OF HUMANITY SOMETHING INTERESTING AND USEFUL WILL BEGIN TO HAPPEN
tst2013.talkid1658_146 HOPEFULLY THESE CATEGORIES THESE BINARIES THESE OVER SIMPLIFIED BOXES WILL BEGIN TO BECOME USELESS AND THEY'LL BEGIN TO FALL AWAY
tst2013.talkid1658_147 BECAUSE REALLY THEY DESCRIBE NOTHING THAT WE SEE AND NO ONE THAT WE KNOW AND NOTHING THAT WE ARE
tst2013.talkid1658_148 WHAT WE SEE ARE HUMAN BEINGS IN ALL THEIR MULTIPLICITY
tst2013.talkid1658_149 AND SEEING THEM MAKES IT HARDER TO DENY THEIR HUMANITY
tst2013.talkid1658_150 AT THE VERY LEAST I HOPE IT MAKES IT HARDER TO DENY THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS
tst2013.talkid1658_151 SO IS IT ME PARTICULARLY THAT YOU WOULD CHOOSE TO DENY THE RIGHT TO HOUSING THE RIGHT TO ADOPT CHILDREN THE RIGHT TO MARRIAGE THE FREEDOM TO SHOP HERE LIVE HERE BUY HERE
tst2013.talkid1658_152 AM I THE ONE THAT YOU CHOOSE TO DISOWN AS YOUR CHILD OR YOUR BROTHER OR YOUR SISTER OR YOUR MOTHER OR YOUR FATHER YOUR NEIGHBOR YOUR COUSIN YOUR UNCLE THE PRESIDENT YOUR POLICE WOMAN OR THE FIREMAN
tst2013.talkid1658_153 IT'S TOO LATE
tst2013.talkid1658_154 BECAUSE I ALREADY AM ALL OF THOSE THINGS
tst2013.talkid1658_155 WE ALREADY ARE ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND WE ALWAYS HAVE BEEN
tst2013.talkid1658_156 SO PLEASE DON'T GREET US AS STRANGERS GREET US AS YOUR FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS PERIOD
tst2013.talkid1658_157 THANK YOU
tst2013.talkid1659_000 I HAVE NEVER EVER FORGOTTEN THE WORDS OF MY GRANDMOTHER WHO DIED IN HER EXILE SON RESIST GADDAFI FIGHT HIM
tst2013.talkid1659_001 BUT DON'T YOU EVER TURN INTO A GADDAFI LIKE REVOLUTIONARY
tst2013.talkid1659_002 ALMOST TWO YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE THE LIBYAN REVOLUTION BROKE OUT INSPIRED BY THE WAVES OF MASS MOBILIZATION IN BOTH THE TUNISIAN AND THE EGYPTIAN REVOLUTION
tst2013.talkid1659_003 I JOINED FORCES WITH MANY OTHER LIBYANS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE LIBYA TO CALL FOR A DAY OF RAGE AND TO INITIATE A REVOLUTION AGAINST THE TYRANNICAL REGIME OF GADDAFI
tst2013.talkid1659_004 AND THERE IT WAS A GREAT REVOLUTION
tst2013.talkid1659_005 YOUNG LIBYAN WOMEN AND MEN WERE AT THE FOREFRONT CALLING FOR THE FALL OF THE REGIME RAISING SLOGANS OF FREEDOM DIGNITY SOCIAL JUSTICE
tst2013.talkid1659_006 THEY HAVE SHOWN AN EXEMPLARY BRAVERY IN CONFRONTING THE BRUTAL DICTATORSHIP OF GADDAFI
tst2013.talkid1659_007 THEY HAVE SHOWN A GREAT SENSE OF SOLIDARITY FROM THE FAR EAST TO THE FAR WEST TO THE SOUTH
tst2013.talkid1659_008 EVENTUALLY AFTER A PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS OF BRUTAL WAR AND A TOLL RATE OF ALMOST FIFTY THOUSAND DEAD WE MANAGED TO LIBERATE OUR COUNTRY AND TO TOPPLE THE TYRANT
tst2013.talkid1659_009 HOWEVER GADDAFI LEFT BEHIND A HEAVY BURDEN A LEGACY OF TYRANNY CORRUPTION AND SEEDS OF DIVERSIONS
tst2013.talkid1659_010 FOR FOUR DECADES GADDAFI'S TYRANNICAL REGIME DESTROYED THE INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL AS THE CULTURE AND THE MORAL FABRIC OF LIBYAN SOCIETY
tst2013.talkid1659_011 AWARE OF THE DEVASTATION AND THE CHALLENGES I WAS KEEN AMONG MANY OTHER WOMEN TO REBUILD THE LIBYAN CIVIL SOCIETY CALLING FOR AN INCLUSIVE AND JUST TRANSITION TO DEMOCRACY AND NATIONAL RECONCILIATION
tst2013.talkid1659_012 ALMOST TWO HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS WERE ESTABLISHED IN BENGHAZI DURING AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FALL OF GADDAFI ALMOST THREE HUNDRED IN TRIPOLI
tst2013.talkid1659_013 AFTER A PERIOD OF THIRTY THREE YEARS IN EXILE I WENT BACK TO LIBYA AND WITH UNIQUE ENTHUSIASM I STARTED ORGANIZING WORKSHOPS ON CAPACITY BUILDING ON HUMAN DEVELOPMENT OF LEADERSHIP SKILLS
tst2013.talkid1659_014 WITH AMAZING GROUP OF WOMEN I CO FOUNDED THE LIBYAN WOMEN'S PLATFORM FOR PEACE A MOVEMENT OF WOMEN LEADERS FROM DIFFERENT WALKS OF LIFE TO LOBBY FOR THE SOCIOPOLITICAL EMPOWERMENT OF WOMEN AND TO LOBBY FOR OUR RIGHT FOR EQUAL PARTICIPATION IN BUILDING DEMOCRACY AND PEACE
tst2013.talkid1659_015 I MET A VERY DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT IN THE PRE ELECTIONS AN ENVIRONMENT WHICH WAS INCREASINGLY POLARIZED AN ENVIRONMENT WHICH WAS SHAPED BY THE SELFISH POLITICS OF DOMINANCE AND EXCLUSION
tst2013.talkid1659_016 I LED AN INITIATIVE BY THE LIBYAN WOMEN'S PLATFORM FOR PEACE TO LOBBY FOR A MORE INCLUSIVE ELECTORAL LAW A LAW THAT WOULD GIVE EVERY CITIZEN NO MATTER WHAT YOUR BACKGROUND THE RIGHT TO VOTE AND RUN AND MOST IMPORTANTLY TO STIPULATE ON POLITICAL PARTIES THE ALTERNATION OF MALE AND FEMALE CANDIDATES VERTICALLY AND HORIZONTALLY IN THEIR LISTS CREATING THE ZIPPER LIST
tst2013.talkid1659_017 EVENTUALLY OUR INITIATIVE WAS ADOPTED AND SUCCESSFUL
tst2013.talkid1659_018 WOMEN WON SEVENTEEN POINT FIVE PERCENT OF THE NATIONAL CONGRESS IN THE FIRST ELECTIONS EVER IN FIFTY TWO YEARS
tst2013.talkid1659_019 HOWEVER BIT BY BIT THE EUPHORIA OF THE ELECTIONS AND OF THE REVOLUTION AS A WHOLE WAS FADING OUT FOR EVERY DAY WE WERE WAKING UP ON THE NEWS OF VIOLENCE
tst2013.talkid1659_020 ONE DAY WE WAKE UP ON THE NEWS OF THE DESECRATION OF ANCIENT MOSQUES AND SUFI TOMBS
tst2013.talkid1659_021 ON ANOTHER DAY WE WAKE UP ON THE NEWS OF THE MURDER OF THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR AND THE ATTACK ON THE CONSULATE
tst2013.talkid1659_022 ON ANOTHER DAY WE WAKE UP ON THE NEWS OF THE ASSASSINATION OF ARMY OFFICERS
tst2013.talkid1659_023 AND EVERY DAY EVERY DAY WE WAKE UP WITH THE RULE OF THE MILITIAS AND THEIR CONTINUOUS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS OF PRISONERS AND THEIR DISRESPECT OF THE RULE OF LAW
tst2013.talkid1659_024 OUR SOCIETY SHAPED BY A REVOLUTIONARY MINDSET BECAME MORE POLARIZED AND HAS DRIVEN AWAY FROM THE IDEALS AND THE PRINCIPLES FREEDOM DIGNITY SOCIAL JUSTICE THAT WE FIRST HELD
tst2013.talkid1659_025 INTOLERANCE EXCLUSION AND REVENGE BECAME THE ICONS OF THE POSTMATH OF THE REVOLUTION
tst2013.talkid1659_026 I AM HERE TODAY NOT AT ALL TO INSPIRE YOU WITH OUR SUCCESS STORY OF THE ZIPPER LIST AND THE ELECTIONS
tst2013.talkid1659_027 I'M RATHER HERE TODAY TO CONFESS THAT WE AS A NATION TOOK THE WRONG CHOICE MADE THE WRONG DECISION
tst2013.talkid1659_028 WE DID NOT PRIORITIZE RIGHT
tst2013.talkid1659_029 FOR ELECTIONS DID NOT BRING PEACE AND STABILITY AND SECURITY IN LIBYA
tst2013.talkid1659_030 DID THE ZIPPER LIST AND THE ALTERNATION BETWEEN FEMALE AND MALE CANDIDATES BRING PEACE AND NATIONAL RECONCILIATION
tst2013.talkid1659_031 NO IT DIDN'T
tst2013.talkid1659_032 WHAT IS IT THEN
tst2013.talkid1659_033 WHY DOES OUR SOCIETY CONTINUE TO BE POLARIZED AND DOMINATED WITH SELFISH POLITICS OF DOMINANCE AND EXCLUSION BY BOTH MEN AND WOMEN
tst2013.talkid1659_034 MAYBE WHAT'S MISSING WERE NOT THE WOMEN ONLY BUT THE FEMININE VALUES OF COMPASSION MERCY AND INCLUSION
tst2013.talkid1659_035 OUR SOCIETY NEED NATIONAL DIALOGUE AND CONSENSUS BUILDING MORE THAN IT NEEDED THE ELECTIONS WHICH ONLY REINFORCED POLARIZATION AND DIVISION
tst2013.talkid1659_036 OUR SOCIETY NEEDS THE QUALITATIVE REPRESENTATION OF THE FEMININE MORE THAN IT NEEDS THE NUMERICAL QUANTITATIVE REPRESENTATION OF THE FEMININE
tst2013.talkid1659_037 WE NEED TO STOP ACTING AS AGENTS OF RAGE AND CALLING FOR DAYS OF RAGE
tst2013.talkid1659_038 WE NEED TO START ACTING AS AGENTS OF COMPASSION AND MERCY
tst2013.talkid1659_039 WE NEED TO DEVELOP A FEMININE DISCOURSE THAT NOT ONLY HONORS BUT ALSO IMPLEMENTS MERCY INSTEAD OF REVENGE COLLABORATION INSTEAD OF COMPETITION INCLUSION INSTEAD OF EXCLUSION
tst2013.talkid1659_040 THESE ARE THE IDEALS THAT A WAR TORN LIBYA NEEDS DESPERATELY IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE PEACE
tst2013.talkid1659_041 FOR PEACE HAS AN ALCHEMY AND THIS ALCHEMY IS ABOUT THE INTERTWINING THE ALTERNATION BETWEEN THE FEMININE AND MASCULINE PERSPECTIVE
tst2013.talkid1659_042 THAT'S THE REAL ZIPPER
tst2013.talkid1659_043 AND WE NEED TO ESTABLISH THAT EXISTENTIALLY BEFORE WE DO SO SOCIOPOLITICALLY
tst2013.talkid1659_044 ACCORDING TO A QURANIC VERSE SALAM PEACE IS THE WORD OF THE ALL MERCIFUL GOD RAHEEM
tst2013.talkid1659_045 IN TURN THE WORD RAHEEM WHICH IS KNOWN IN ALL ABRAHAMIC TRADITIONS HAS THE SAME ROOT IN ARABIC AS THE WORD RAHEM WOMB SYMBOLIZING THE MATERNAL FEMININE ENCOMPASSING ALL HUMANITY FROM WHICH THE MALE AND THE FEMALE FROM WHICH ALL TRIBES ALL PEOPLES HAVE EMANATED FROM
tst2013.talkid1659_046 AND SO JUST AS THE WOMB ENTIRELY ENVELOPES THE EMBRYO WHICH GROWS WITHIN IT THE DIVINE MATRIX OF COMPASSION NOURISHES THE ENTIRE EXISTENCE
tst2013.talkid1659_047 THUS WE ARE TOLD THAT MY MERCY ENCOMPASSES ALL THINGS
tst2013.talkid1659_048 THUS WE ARE TOLD THAT MY MERCY TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER MY ANGER
tst2013.talkid1659_049 MAY WE ALL BE GRANTED A GRACE OF MERCY
tst2013.talkid1659_050 THANK YOU
tst2013.talkid1665_000 YOU PROBABLY ALL AGREE WITH ME THAT THIS IS A VERY NICE ROAD
tst2013.talkid1665_001 IT'S MADE OF ASPHALT AND ASPHALT IS A VERY NICE MATERIAL TO DRIVE ON BUT NOT ALWAYS ESPECIALLY NOT ON THESE DAYS AS TODAY WHEN IT'S RAINING A LOT
tst2013.talkid1665_002 THEN YOU CAN HAVE A LOT OF SPLASH WATER IN THE ASPHALT
tst2013.talkid1665_003 AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU THEN RIDE WITH YOUR BICYCLE AND PASS THESE CARS THEN THAT'S NOT VERY NICE
tst2013.talkid1665_004 ALSO ASPHALT CAN CREATE A LOT OF NOISE
tst2013.talkid1665_005 IT'S A NOISY MATERIAL AND IF WE PRODUCE ROADS LIKE IN THE NETHERLANDS VERY CLOSE TO CITIES THEN WE WOULD LIKE A SILENT ROAD
tst2013.talkid1665_006 THE SOLUTION FOR THAT IS TO MAKE ROADS OUT OF POROUS ASPHALT
tst2013.talkid1665_007 POROUS ASPHALT A MATERIAL THAT WE USE NOW IN MOST OF THE HIGHWAYS IN THE NETHERLANDS IT HAS PORES AND WATER CAN JUST RAIN THROUGH IT SO ALL THE RAINWATER WILL FLOW AWAY TO THE SIDES AND YOU HAVE A ROAD THAT'S EASY TO DRIVE ON SO NO SPLASH WATER ANYMORE
tst2013.talkid1665_008 ALSO THE NOISE WILL DISAPPEAR IN THESE PORES
tst2013.talkid1665_009 BECAUSE IT'S VERY HOLLOW ALL THE NOISE WILL DISAPPEAR SO IT'S A VERY SILENT ROAD
tst2013.talkid1665_010 IT ALSO HAS DISADVANTAGES OF COURSE AND THE DISADVANTAGE OF THIS ROAD IS THAT RAVELING CAN OCCUR
tst2013.talkid1665_011 WHAT IS RAVELING YOU SEE THAT IN THIS ROAD THAT THE STONES AT THE SURFACE COME OFF
tst2013.talkid1665_012 FIRST YOU GET ONE STONE THEN SEVERAL MORE AND MORE AND MORE AND MORE AND MORE AND THEN THEY WELL I WILL NOT DO THAT
tst2013.talkid1665_013 BUT THEY CAN DAMAGE YOUR WINDSHIELD SO YOU'RE NOT HAPPY WITH THAT
tst2013.talkid1665_014 AND FINALLY THIS RAVELING CAN ALSO LEAD TO MORE AND MORE DAMAGE
tst2013.talkid1665_015 SOMETIMES YOU CAN CREATE POTHOLES WITH THAT
tst2013.talkid1665_016 HA HE'S READY
tst2013.talkid1665_017 POTHOLES OF COURSE THAT CAN BECOME A PROBLEM BUT WE HAVE A SOLUTION
tst2013.talkid1665_018 HERE YOU SEE ACTUALLY HOW THE DAMAGE APPEARS IN THIS MATERIAL
tst2013.talkid1665_019 IT'S A POROUS ASPHALT LIKE I SAID SO YOU HAVE ONLY A SMALL AMOUNT OF BINDER BETWEEN THE STONES
tst2013.talkid1665_020 DUE TO WEATHERING DUE TO UV LIGHT DUE TO OXIDATION THIS BINDER THIS BITUMEN THE GLUE BETWEEN THE AGGREGATES IS GOING TO SHRINK AND IF IT SHRINKS YOU GET MICRO CRACKS AND IT DELAMINATES FROM THE AGGREGATES
tst2013.talkid1665_021 THEN IF YOU DRIVE OVER THE ROAD YOU TAKE OUT THE AGGREGATES WHAT WE JUST SAW HERE
tst2013.talkid1665_022 TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM WE THOUGHT OF SELF HEALING MATERIALS
tst2013.talkid1665_023 IF WE CAN MAKE THIS MATERIAL SELF HEALING THEN PROBABLY WE HAVE A SOLUTION
tst2013.talkid1665_024 SO WHAT WE CAN DO IS USE STEEL WOOL JUST TO CLEAN PANS AND THE STEEL WOOL WE CAN CUT IN VERY SMALL PIECES AND THESE VERY SMALL PIECES WE CAN MIX TO THE BITUMEN
tst2013.talkid1665_025 SO THEN YOU HAVE ASPHALT WITH VERY SMALL PIECES OF STEEL WOOL IN IT
tst2013.talkid1665_026 THEN YOU NEED THE MACHINE LIKE YOU SEE HERE THAT YOU CAN USE FOR COOKING INDUCTION MACHINE
tst2013.talkid1665_027 INDUCTION CAN HEAT ESPECIALLY STEEL IT'S VERY GOOD AT THAT
tst2013.talkid1665_028 THEN WHAT YOU DO IS YOU HEAT UP THE STEEL YOU MELT THE BITUMEN AND THE BITUMEN WILL FLOW INTO THESE MICRO CRACKS AND THE STONES ARE AGAIN FIXED TO THE SURFACE
tst2013.talkid1665_029 TODAY I USE A MICROWAVE BECAUSE I CANNOT TAKE THE BIG INDUCTION MACHINE HERE ONSTAGE
tst2013.talkid1665_030 SO A MICROWAVE IS A SIMILAR SYSTEM
tst2013.talkid1665_031 SO I PUT THE SPECIMEN IN WHICH I'M NOW GOING TO TAKE OUT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED
tst2013.talkid1665_032 SO THIS IS THE SPECIMEN COMING OUT NOW
tst2013.talkid1665_033 SO I SAID WE HAVE WE HAVE SUCH AN INDUSTRIAL MACHINE IN THE LAB TO UH HEAT UP THE THE SPECIMENS
tst2013.talkid1665_034 WE TESTED A LOT OF SPECIMENS THERE AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT THEY ACTUALLY SAW OUR RESULTS AND THEY THOUGHT WELL THAT'S VERY INTERESTING WE HAVE TO TRY THAT
tst2013.talkid1665_035 SO THEY DONATED TO US A PIECE OF HIGHWAY FOUR HUNDRED METERS OF THE A FIFTY EIGHT WHERE WE HAD TO MAKE A TEST TRACK TO TEST THIS MATERIAL
tst2013.talkid1665_036 SO THAT'S WHAT WE DID HERE YOU SEE WHERE WE WERE MAKING THE TEST ROAD AND THEN OF COURSE THIS ROAD WILL LAST SEVERAL YEARS WITHOUT ANY DAMAGE THAT'S WHAT WE KNOW FROM PRACTICE
tst2013.talkid1665_037 SO WE TOOK A LOT OF SAMPLES FROM THIS ROAD AND WE TESTED THEM IN THE LAB
tst2013.talkid1665_038 SO WE DID UH AGING ON THE SAMPLES DID A LOT OF LOADING ON IT HEALED THEM WITH OUR INDUCTION MACHINE AND UM HEALED THEM AND TESTED THEM AGAIN
tst2013.talkid1665_039 SEVERAL TIMES WE CAN REPEAT THAT
tst2013.talkid1665_040 SO ACTUALLY THE CONCLUSION FROM THIS RESEARCH IS THAT IF WE GO ON THE ROAD EVERY FOUR YEARS WITH OUR HEALING MACHINE THIS IS THE BIG VERSION WE HAVE MADE TO GO ON THE REAL ROAD IF WE GO ON THE ROAD EVERY FOUR YEARS WE CAN DOUBLE THE SURFACE LIFE OF THIS ROAD WHICH OF COURSE SAVES A LOT OF MONEY
tst2013.talkid1665_041 WELL TO CONCLUDE I CAN SAY THAT WE MADE MATERIAL USING STEEL FIBERS THE ADDITION OF STEEL FIBERS USING INDUCTION ENERGY TO REALLY INCREASE THE SURFACE LIFE OF THE ROAD DOUBLE THE SURFACE LIFE YOU CAN EVEN DO SO IT WILL REALLY SAVE A LOT OF MONEY WITH VERY SIMPLE TRICKS
tst2013.talkid1665_042 AND NOW YOU'RE OF COURSE CURIOUS IF IT ALSO WORKED
tst2013.talkid1665_043 SO WE STILL HAVE THE SPECIMEN HERE IT'S QUITE WARM
tst2013.talkid1665_044 ACTUALLY IT STILL HAS TO COOL DOWN FIRST BEFORE I CAN SHOW YOU THAT THE HEALING WORKS
tst2013.talkid1665_045 BUT I WILL DO A TRIAL
tst2013.talkid1665_046 LET'S SEE YEAH IT WORKED
tst2013.talkid1665_047 THANK YOU
tst2013.talkid1666_000 WHEN I WAS ELEVEN I REMEMBER WAKING UP ONE MORNING TO THE SOUND OF JOY IN MY HOUSE
tst2013.talkid1666_001 MY FATHER WAS LISTENING TO BBC NEWS ON HIS SMALL GRAY RADIO
tst2013.talkid1666_002 THERE WAS A BIG SMILE ON HIS FACE WHICH WAS UNUSUAL THEN BECAUSE THE NEWS MOSTLY DEPRESSED HIM
tst2013.talkid1666_003 THE TALIBAN ARE GONE MY FATHER SHOUTED
tst2013.talkid1666_004 I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANT BUT I COULD SEE THAT MY FATHER WAS VERY VERY HAPPY
tst2013.talkid1666_005 YOU CAN GO TO A REAL SCHOOL NOW HE SAID
tst2013.talkid1666_006 A MORNING THAT I WILL NEVER FORGET
tst2013.talkid1666_007 A REAL SCHOOL
tst2013.talkid1666_008 YOU SEE I WAS SIX WHEN TALIBAN TOOK OVER AFGHANISTAN AND MADE IT ILLEGAL FOR GIRLS TO GO TO SCHOOL
tst2013.talkid1666_009 SO FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS I DRESSED AS A BOY TO ESCORT MY OLDER SISTER WHO WAS NO LONGER ALLOWED TO BE OUTSIDE ALONE TO A SECRET SCHOOL
tst2013.talkid1666_010 IT WAS THE ONLY WAY WE BOTH COULD BE EDUCATED
tst2013.talkid1666_011 EACH DAY WE TOOK A DIFFERENT ROUTE SO THAT NO ONE WOULD SUSPECT WHERE WE WERE GOING
tst2013.talkid1666_012 WE WOULD COVER OUR BOOKS IN GROCERY BAGS SO IT WOULD SEEM WE WERE JUST OUT SHOPPING
tst2013.talkid1666_013 THE SCHOOL WAS IN A HOUSE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED OF US PACKED IN ONE SMALL LIVING ROOM
tst2013.talkid1666_014 IT WAS COZY IN WINTER BUT EXTREMELY HOT IN SUMMER
tst2013.talkid1666_015 WE ALL KNEW WE WERE RISKING OUR LIVES THE TEACHER THE STUDENTS AND OUR PARENTS
tst2013.talkid1666_016 FROM TIME TO TIME THE SCHOOL WOULD SUDDENLY BE CANCELED FOR A WEEK BECAUSE TALIBAN WERE SUSPICIOUS
tst2013.talkid1666_017 WE ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT THEY KNEW ABOUT US
tst2013.talkid1666_018 WERE WE BEING FOLLOWED
tst2013.talkid1666_019 DO THEY KNOW WHERE WE LIVE
tst2013.talkid1666_020 WE WERE SCARED BUT STILL SCHOOL WAS WHERE WE WANTED TO BE
tst2013.talkid1666_021 I WAS VERY LUCKY TO GROW UP IN A FAMILY WHERE EDUCATION WAS PRIZED AND DAUGHTERS WERE TREASURED
tst2013.talkid1666_022 MY GRANDFATHER WAS AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN FOR HIS TIME
tst2013.talkid1666_023 A TOTAL MAVERICK FROM A REMOTE PROVINCE OF AFGHANISTAN HE INSISTED THAT HIS DAUGHTER MY MOM UH GO TO SCHOOL AND FOR THAT HE WAS DISOWNED BY HIS FATHER
tst2013.talkid1666_024 BUT MY EDUCATED MOTHER BECAME A TEACHER
tst2013.talkid1666_025 THERE SHE IS
tst2013.talkid1666_026 SHE RETIRED TWO YEARS AGO ONLY TO TURN OUR HOUSE INTO A SCHOOL FOR GIRLS AND WOMEN IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD
tst2013.talkid1666_027 AND MY FATHER THAT'S HIM HE WAS THE FIRST EVER IN HIS FAMILY TO RECEIVE AN EDUCATION
tst2013.talkid1666_028 THERE WAS NO QUESTION THAT HIS CHILDREN WOULD RECEIVE AN EDUCATION INCLUDING HIS DAUGHTERS DESPITE THE TALIBAN DESPITE THE RISKS
tst2013.talkid1666_029 TO HIM THERE WAS GREATER RISK IN NOT EDUCATING HIS CHILDREN
tst2013.talkid1666_030 DURING TALIBAN YEARS I REMEMBER THERE WERE TIMES I WOULD GET SO FRUSTRATED BY OUR LIFE AND ALWAYS BEING SCARED AND NOT SEEING A FUTURE
tst2013.talkid1666_031 I WOULD WANT TO QUIT BUT MY FATHER HE WOULD SAY LISTEN MY DAUGHTER YOU CAN LOSE EVERYTHING YOU OWN IN YOUR LIFE
tst2013.talkid1666_032 YOUR MONEY CAN BE STOLEN YOU CAN BE FORCED TO LEAVE YOUR HOME DURING A WAR
tst2013.talkid1666_033 BUT THE ONE THING THAT WILL ALWAYS REMAIN WITH YOU IS WHAT IS HERE AND IF WE HAVE TO SELL OUR BLOOD TO PAY YOUR SCHOOL FEES WE WILL
tst2013.talkid1666_034 SO DO YOU STILL NOT WANT TO CONTINUE
tst2013.talkid1666_035 TODAY I AM TWENTY TWO
tst2013.talkid1666_036 I WAS RAISED IN A COUNTRY THAT HAS BEEN DESTROYED BY DECADES OF WAR
tst2013.talkid1666_037 FEWER THAN SIX PERCENT OF WOMEN MY AGE HAVE MADE IT BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL AND HAD MY FAMILY NOT BEEN SO COMMITTED TO MY EDUCATION I WOULD BE ONE OF THEM
tst2013.talkid1666_038 INSTEAD I STAND HERE A PROUD GRADUATE OF MIDDLEBURY COLLEGE
tst2013.talkid1666_039 WHEN I RETURNED TO AFGHANISTAN MY GRANDFATHER THE ONE EXILED FROM HIS HOME FOR DARING TO EDUCATE HIS DAUGHTERS WAS AMONG THE FIRST TO CONGRATULATE ME
tst2013.talkid1666_040 HE NOT ONLY BRAGS ABOUT MY COLLEGE DEGREE BUT ALSO THAT I WAS THE FIRST WOMAN AND THAT I AM THE FIRST WOMAN TO DRIVE HIM THROUGH THE STREETS OF KABUL
tst2013.talkid1666_041 MY FAMILY BELIEVES IN ME
tst2013.talkid1666_042 I DREAM BIG BUT MY FAMILY DREAMS EVEN BIGGER FOR ME
tst2013.talkid1666_043 THAT'S WHY I AM A GLOBAL AMBASSADOR FOR TEN TIMES TEN A GLOBAL CAMPAIGN TO EDUCATE WOMEN
tst2013.talkid1666_044 THAT'S WHY I COFOUNDED SOLA THE FIRST AND PERHAPS ONLY BOARDING SCHOOL FOR GIRLS IN AFGHANISTAN A COUNTRY WHERE IT'S STILL RISKY FOR GIRLS TO GO TO SCHOOL
tst2013.talkid1666_045 THE EXCITING THING IS THAT I SEE STUDENTS AT MY SCHOOL WITH AMBITION GRABBING AT OPPORTUNITY
tst2013.talkid1666_046 AND I SEE THEIR PARENTS AND THEIR FATHERS WHO LIKE MY OWN ADVOCATE FOR THEM DESPITE AND EVEN IN THE FACE OF DAUNTING OPPOSITION
tst2013.talkid1666_047 LIKE AHMED THAT'S NOT HIS REAL NAME AND I CANNOT SHOW YOU HIS FACE BUT AHMED IS THE FATHER OF ONE OF MY STUDENTS
tst2013.talkid1666_048 LESS THAN A MONTH AGO HE AND HIS DAUGHTER WERE ON ON THEIR WAY FROM SOLA TO THEIR VILLAGE AND THEY LITERALLY MISSED BEING KILLED BY A ROADSIDE BOMB BY MINUTES
tst2013.talkid1666_049 AS HE ARRIVED HOME THE PHONE RANG A VOICE WARNING HIM THAT IF HE SENT HIS DAUGHTER BACK TO SCHOOL THEY WOULD TRY AGAIN
tst2013.talkid1666_050 KILL ME NOW IF YOU WISH HE SAID BUT I WILL NOT RUIN MY DAUGHTER'S FUTURE BECAUSE OF YOUR OLD AND BACKWARD IDEAS
tst2013.talkid1666_051 WHAT I'VE COME TO REALIZE ABOUT AFGHANISTAN AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS OFTEN DISMISSED IN THE WEST THAT BEHIND MOST MOST OF US WHO SUCCEED IS A FATHER WHO RECOGNIZES THE VALUE IN HIS DAUGHTER AND WHO SEES THAT HER SUCCESS IS HIS SUCCESS
tst2013.talkid1666_052 IT'S NOT TO SAY THAT OUR MOTHERS AREN'T KEY IN OUR SUCCESS
tst2013.talkid1666_053 IN FACT THEY'RE OFTEN THE INITIAL AND CONVINCING NEGOTIATORS OF A BRIGHT FUTURE FOR THEIR DAUGHTERS BUT IN THE CONTEXT OF A SOCIETY LIKE IN AFGHANISTAN WE MUST HAVE THE SUPPORT OF MEN
tst2013.talkid1666_054 UNDER THE TALIBAN GIRLS WHO WENT TO SCHOOL NUMBERED IN HUNDREDS REMEMBER IT WAS ILLEGAL
tst2013.talkid1666_055 BUT TODAY MORE THAN THREE MILLION GIRLS ARE IN SCHOOL IN AFGHANISTAN
tst2013.talkid1666_056 AFGHANISTAN LOOKS SO DIFFERENT FROM HERE IN AMERICA
tst2013.talkid1666_057 I FIND THAT AMERICANS SEE THE FRAGILITY IN CHANGES
tst2013.talkid1666_058 I FEAR THAT THESE CHANGES WILL NOT LAST MUCH BEYOND THE US TROOPS' WITHDRAWAL
tst2013.talkid1666_059 BUT WHEN I AM BACK IN AFGHANISTAN WHEN I SEE THE STUDENTS IN MY SCHOOL AND THEIR PARENTS WHO ADVOCATE FOR THEM WHO ENCOURAGE THEM I SEE A PROMISING FUTURE AND LASTING CHANGE
tst2013.talkid1666_060 TO ME AFGHANISTAN IS A COUNTRY OF HOPE AND BOUNDLESS POSSIBILITIES AND EVERY SINGLE DAY THE GIRLS OF SOLA REMIND ME OF THAT
tst2013.talkid1666_061 LIKE ME THEY ARE DREAMING BIG
tst2013.talkid1666_062 THANK YOU
tst2013.talkid1673_000 OKAY THIS MORNING I'M SPEAKING ON THE QUESTION OF CORRUPTION
tst2013.talkid1673_001 AND CORRUPTION IS DEFINED AS THE ABUSE OF A POSITION OF TRUST FOR THE BENEFIT OF YOURSELF OR IN THE CASE OF OUR CONTEXT YOUR FRIENDS YOUR FAMILY OR YOUR FINANCIERS
tst2013.talkid1673_002 OKAY FRIENDS FAMILY AND FINANCIERS
tst2013.talkid1673_003 BUT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE UNDERSTAND ABOUT CORRUPTION AND WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE BEEN MISEDUCATED ABOUT IT AND WE HAVE TO ADMIT THAT
tst2013.talkid1673_004 WE HAVE TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO ADMIT THAT TO START CHANGING HOW WE DEAL WITH IT
tst2013.talkid1673_005 THE FIRST THING IS THAT THE BIG MYTH NUMBER ONE IS THAT IN FACT IT'S NOT REALLY A CRIME
tst2013.talkid1673_006 WHEN WE GET TOGETHER WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND WE DISCUSS CRIME IN OUR COUNTRY CRIME IN BELMONT OR CRIME IN DIEGO OR CRIME IN MARABELLA NOBODY'S SPEAKING ABOUT CORRUPTION
tst2013.talkid1673_007 THAT'S THE HONEST TRUTH
tst2013.talkid1673_008 WHEN THE COMMISSIONER OF POLICE COMES ON TV TO TALK ABOUT CRIME HE ISN'T SPEAKING ABOUT CORRUPTION
tst2013.talkid1673_009 AND WE KNOW FOR SURE WHEN THE MINISTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY IS SPEAKING ABOUT CRIME HE'S NOT TALKING ABOUT CORRUPTION EITHER
tst2013.talkid1673_010 THE POINT I'M MAKING IS THAT IT IS A CRIME
tst2013.talkid1673_011 IT IS AN ECONOMIC CRIME BECAUSE WE'RE INVOLVING THE LOOTING OF TAXPAYERS' MONEY
tst2013.talkid1673_012 PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CORRUPTION IS A REALITY
tst2013.talkid1673_013 AS SOMEBODY WHO COMES FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR I CAN TELL YOU THERE'S A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF CORRUPTION IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH GOVERNMENT
tst2013.talkid1673_014 THE SAME BRIBES AND BACKHANDERS AND THINGS THAT TAKE PLACE UNDER THE TABLE IT ALL TAKES PLACE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR
tst2013.talkid1673_015 TODAY I'M FOCUSING ON PUBLIC SECTOR CORRUPTION WHICH THE PRIVATE SECTOR ALSO PARTICIPATES IN
tst2013.talkid1673_016 THE SECOND IMPORTANT MYTH TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DESTROY THESE MYTHS DISMANTLE THEM AND DESTROY THEM AND RIDICULE THEM THE SECOND IMPORTANT MYTH TO UNDERSTAND IS THE ONE THAT SAYS THAT IN FACT CORRUPTION IS ONLY A SMALL PROBLEM IF IT IS A PROBLEM IT'S ONLY A SMALL PROBLEM THAT IN FACT IT'S ONLY A LITTLE TEN OR FIFTEEN PERCENT IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOREVER IT PROBABLY WILL CONTINUE FOREVER AND THERE'S NO POINT PASSING ANY LAWS BECAUSE THERE'S LITTLE WE CAN DO ABOUT IT
tst2013.talkid1673_017 AND I WANT TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THAT TOO IS A DANGEROUS MYTH VERY DANGEROUS
tst2013.talkid1673_018 IT'S A PIECE OF PUBLIC MISCHIEF
tst2013.talkid1673_019 AND I WANT TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TAKE US BACK ABOUT THIRTY YEARS
tst2013.talkid1673_020 WE'RE COMING OUT TODAY FROM TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO A RESOURCE RICH SMALL CARIBBEAN COUNTRY AND IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES WE HAD A MASSIVE INCREASE IN THE COUNTRY'S WEALTH AND THAT INCREASE WAS CAUSED BY THE INCREASE IN WORLD OIL PRICES
tst2013.talkid1673_021 WE CALL THEM PETRODOLLARS THE TREASURY WAS BURSTING WITH MONEY
tst2013.talkid1673_022 AND IT'S IRONIC BECAUSE WE'RE STANDING TODAY IN THE CENTRAL BANK
tst2013.talkid1673_023 YOU SEE HISTORY'S RICH IN IRONY
tst2013.talkid1673_024 WE'RE STANDING TODAY IN THE CENTRAL BANK AND THE CENTRAL BANK IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A LOT OF THE THINGS I'M GOING TO BE SPEAKING ABOUT
tst2013.talkid1673_025 OKAY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IRRESPONSIBILITY IN PUBLIC OFFICE
tst2013.talkid1673_026 WE'RE SPEAKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT ACROSS THE TERRACE THE NEXT TOWER IS THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE AND THERE'S A LOT OF CONNECTION WITH US TODAY SO WE'RE SPEAKING WITHIN YOUR TEMPLE TODAY OKAY
tst2013.talkid1673_027 THE FIRST THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS THAT WHEN ALL OF THIS MONEY FLOWED INTO OUR COUNTRY ABOUT FORTY YEARS AGO WE EMBARKED THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY EMBARKED ON A SERIES OF GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT ARRANGEMENTS TO HAVE RAPIDLY DEVELOP THE COUNTRY
tst2013.talkid1673_028 AND SOME OF THE LARGEST PROJECTS IN THE COUNTRY WERE BEING CONSTRUCTED THROUGH GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT ARRANGEMENTS WITH SOME OF THE LEADING COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD THE UNITED STATES AND BRITAIN AND FRANCE AND SO ON AND SO ON
tst2013.talkid1673_029 AS I SAID EVEN THIS BUILDING WE'RE STANDING IN THAT'S ONE OF THE IRONIES THIS BUILDING WAS PART OF THAT SERIES OF COMPLEXES WHAT THEY CALLED THE TWIN TOWERS
tst2013.talkid1673_030 IT BECAME SO OUTRAGEOUS THE WHOLE SITUATION THAT IN FACT A COMMISSION OF INQUIRY WAS APPOINTED AND IT REPORTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO THIRTY YEARS AGO IT REPORTED THE BALLAH REPORT THIRTY YEARS AGO AND IMMEDIATELY THE GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT ARRANGEMENTS WERE STOPPED
tst2013.talkid1673_031 THE THEN PRIME MINISTER WENT TO PARLIAMENT TO GIVE A BUDGET SPEECH AND HE SAID SOME THINGS THAT I'LL NEVER FORGET
tst2013.talkid1673_032 THEY WENT RIGHT IN HERE I WAS A YOUNG MAN AT THE TIME
tst2013.talkid1673_033 IT WENT RIGHT INTO MY HEART
tst2013.talkid1673_034 AND HE SAID THAT IN FACT LET ME SEE IF THIS THING WORKS
tst2013.talkid1673_035 ARE WE GETTING A YEAH THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD US
tst2013.talkid1673_036 HE TOLD US THAT IN FACT TWO OUT OF EVERY THREE DOLLARS OF OUR PETRODOLLARS THAT WE SPENT THE TAXPAYERS' MONEY WAS WASTED OR STOLEN
tst2013.talkid1673_037 SO THE TEN OR FIFTEEN PERCENT IS PURE MISCHIEF
tst2013.talkid1673_038 AS WE SAY IT'S A NANCY STORY FORGET IT
tst2013.talkid1673_039 THAT'S FOR LITTLE CHILDREN WE ARE BIG PEOPLE AND WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR SOCIETY
tst2013.talkid1673_040 OKAY THIS IS THE SIZE OF THE PROBLEM
tst2013.talkid1673_041 OKAY TWO THIRDS OF THE MONEY STOLEN OR WASTED
tst2013.talkid1673_042 THAT WAS THIRTY YEARS AGO NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO WAS BALLAH
tst2013.talkid1673_043 SO WHAT HAS CHANGED
tst2013.talkid1673_044 I DON'T LIKE TO BRING UP EMBARRASSING SECRETS TO AN INTERNATIONAL AUDIENCE BUT I HAVE TO
tst2013.talkid1673_045 FOUR MONTHS AGO WE SUFFERED A CONSTITUTIONAL OUTRAGE IN THIS COUNTRY
tst2013.talkid1673_046 WE CALL IT THE SECTION THIRTY FOUR FIASCO THE SECTION THIRTY FOUR FIASCO A SUSPICIOUS PIECE OF LAW AND I'M GOING TO SAY IT LIKE IT IS A SUSPICIOUS PIECE OF LAW WAS PASSED AT A SUSPICIOUS TIME TO FREE SOME SUSPECTS
tst2013.talkid1673_047 AND IT WAS CALLED THOSE PEOPLE ARE CALLED THE PIARCO AIRPORT ACCUSED
tst2013.talkid1673_048 I'M GOING TO HAVE MY OWN LEXICON SPEAKING HERE TODAY
tst2013.talkid1673_049 THEY ARE THE PIARCO AIRPORT ACCUSED
tst2013.talkid1673_050 IT WAS A CONSTITUTIONAL OUTRAGE OF THE FIRST ORDER AND I HAVE LABELED IT THE PLOT TO PERVERT PARLIAMENT
tst2013.talkid1673_051 OUR HIGHEST INSTITUTION IN OUR COUNTRY WAS PERVERTED
tst2013.talkid1673_052 WE ARE DEALING WITH PERVERTS HERE OF AN ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL NATURE
tst2013.talkid1673_053 DO YOU GET HOW SERIOUS THIS PROBLEM IS
tst2013.talkid1673_054 THERE WAS MASSIVE PROTEST A LOT OF US IN THIS ROOM TOOK PART IN THE PROTEST IN DIFFERENT FORMS
tst2013.talkid1673_055 MOST IMPORTANTLY THE AMERICAN EMBASSY COMPLAINED SO PARLIAMENT WAS SWIFTLY RECONVENED AND THE LAW WAS REVERSED IT WAS REPEALED
tst2013.talkid1673_056 THAT'S THE WORD LAWYERS USE IT WAS REPEALED
tst2013.talkid1673_057 BUT THE POINT IS THAT PARLIAMENT WAS OUTWITTED IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF EVENTS BECAUSE WHAT REALLY HAPPENED IS THAT BECAUSE OF THE SUSPICIOUS PASSAGE OF THAT LAW THE LAW WAS ACTUALLY PASSED INTO EFFECT ON THE WEEKEND WE CELEBRATED OUR FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF INDEPENDENCE OUR JUBILEE OF INDEPENDENCE
tst2013.talkid1673_058 SO THAT IS THAT IS THE KIND OF OUTRAGE OF THE THING
tst2013.talkid1673_059 IT WAS A KIND OF A NASTY WAY TO GET MATURATION BUT WE GOT IT BECAUSE WE ALL UNDERSTOOD IT AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT I COULD REMEMBER THERE WERE MASS PROTESTS AGAINST THIS CORRUPTION
tst2013.talkid1673_060 AND THAT THAT GAVE ME A LOT OF HOPE
tst2013.talkid1673_061 THOSE OF US WHO ARE SOMETIMES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE A LITTLE BIT ON YOUR OWN DOING SOME OF THIS WORK
tst2013.talkid1673_062 THAT PASSAGE OF THE LAW AND THE REPEAL OF THE LAW FORTIFIED THE CASE OF THE PIARCO AIRPORT ACCUSED
tst2013.talkid1673_063 SO IT WAS ONE OF THOSE REALLY SUPERIOR DOUBLE BLUFF KIND OF THINGS THAT TOOK PLACE
tst2013.talkid1673_064 BUT WHAT WERE THEY ACCUSED OF
tst2013.talkid1673_065 WHAT WAS IT THAT THEY WERE ACCUSED OF
tst2013.talkid1673_066 I'M BEING A BIT MYSTERIOUS FOR THOSE OF YOU OUT THERE WHAT WERE THEY ACCUSED OF
tst2013.talkid1673_067 WE WERE TRYING TO BUILD OR RECONSTRUCT LARGELY AN AIRPORT THAT HAD GROWN OUTDATED
tst2013.talkid1673_068 THE ENTIRE PROJECT COST ABOUT ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS TRINIDAD DOLLARS TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO DOLLARS AND IN FACT WE HAD A LOT OF BID RIGGING AND SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY CORRUPT ACTIVITY TOOK PLACE
tst2013.talkid1673_069 AND TO GET AN IDEA OF WHAT IT CONSISTED OF AND TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT IN RELATIONSHIP TO THIS WHOLE SECOND MYTH ABOUT IT BEING NO BIG THING WE CAN LOOK AT THIS SECOND SLIDE HERE
tst2013.talkid1673_070 AND WHAT WE HAVE HERE THIS IS NOT I AM NOT SAYING SO THIS IS THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS IN A WRITTEN STATEMENT HE SAID SO
tst2013.talkid1673_071 AND HE'S TELLING US THAT FOR THE ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLAR COST OF THE PROJECT ONE BILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN TRACED TO OFFSHORE BANK ACCOUNTS
tst2013.talkid1673_072 ONE BILLION DOLLARS OF OUR TAXPAYERS' MONEY HAS BEEN LOCATED IN OFFSHORE BANK ACCOUNTS
tst2013.talkid1673_073 BEING THE KIND OF SUSPICIOUS PERSON I AM I AM OUTRAGED AT THAT AND I'M GOING TO PAUSE HERE I'M GOING TO PAUSE NOW AND AGAIN AND BRING IN DIFFERENT THINGS
tst2013.talkid1673_074 I'M GOING TO PAUSE HERE AND BRING IN SOMETHING I SAW IN NOVEMBER LAST YEAR AT WALL STREET I WAS AT ZUCCOTTI PARK
tst2013.talkid1673_075 IT WAS IT WAS AUTUMN IT WAS COOL IT WAS DAMP IT WAS GETTING DARK
tst2013.talkid1673_076 AND I WAS WALKING AROUND WITH THE PROTESTERS LOOKING AT THE ONE WALL STREET OCCUPY WALL STREET MOVEMENT WALKING AROUND
tst2013.talkid1673_077 AND THERE WAS A LADY WITH A SIGN A VERY SIMPLE SIGN A KIND OF A BATTERED LOOKING BLONDE LADY AND THE SIGN WAS MADE OUT OF BRISTOL BOARD AS WE SAY IN THESE PARTS AND IT WAS MADE WITH A MARKER
tst2013.talkid1673_078 AND WHAT IT SAID ON THAT SIGN HIT ME RIGHT IN THE CENTER
tst2013.talkid1673_079 IT SAID IF YOU'RE NOT OUTRAGED YOU HAVEN'T BEEN PAYING ATTENTION
tst2013.talkid1673_080 IF YOU'RE NOT OUTRAGED BY ALL OF THIS YOU HAVEN'T BEEN PAYING ATTENTION
tst2013.talkid1673_081 SO LISTEN UP BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING INTO EVEN DEEPER WATERS
tst2013.talkid1673_082 MY BRAIN STARTED THINKING
tst2013.talkid1673_083 WELL WHAT IF BECAUSE I'M SUSPICIOUS LIKE THAT I READ A LOT OF SPY NOVELS AND STUFF
tst2013.talkid1673_084 WHAT IF BUT TO BUT TO MAKE IT BUT TO MAKE IT IN THESE WRONGS YOU HAVE TO READ A LOT OF SPY NOVELS AND FOLLOW SOME OF THAT STUFF RIGHT
tst2013.talkid1673_085 BUT BUT WHAT IF THIS WASN'T THE FIRST TIME
tst2013.talkid1673_086 WHAT IF THIS IS JUST THE FIRST TIME THAT THE SO AND SOS HAD BEEN CAUGHT
tst2013.talkid1673_087 WHAT IF IT HAD HAPPENED BEFORE HOW WOULD I FIND OUT
tst2013.talkid1673_088 NOW THE PREVIOUS TWO EXAMPLES I GAVE WERE TO DO WITH CONSTRUCTION SECTOR CORRUPTION OKAY
tst2013.talkid1673_089 AND I'M I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE AT THIS TIME TO LEAD THE JOINT CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL WHICH IS A NOT FOR PROFIT
tst2013.talkid1673_090 WE'RE AT JCC DOT ORG DOT TT AND WE HAVE THE WE ARE THE LEADERS IN THE STRUGGLE TO PRODUCE A NEW PUBLIC PROCUREMENT SYSTEM ABOUT HOW PUBLIC MONEY IS TRANSACTED
tst2013.talkid1673_091 SO THOSE OF YOU INTERESTED IN FINDING OUT MORE ABOUT IT OR JOINING US OR SIGNING UP ON ANY OF OUR PETITIONS PLEASE GET INVOLVED
tst2013.talkid1673_092 BUT I'M GOING TO SEGUE TO ANOTHER THING THAT RELATES BECAUSE ONE OF MY PRIVATE CAMPAIGNS I'VE BEEN CONDUCTING FOR OVER THREE AND A HALF YEARS IS FOR TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AROUND THE BAILOUT OF CL FINANCIAL
tst2013.talkid1673_093 CL FINANCIAL IS THE CARIBBEAN'S LARGEST EVER CONGLOMERATE OKAY
tst2013.talkid1673_094 AND WITHOUT GETTING INTO ALL OF THE DETAILS IT IS SAID TO HAVE COLLAPSED I'M USING MY WORDS VERY CAREFULLY IT'S SAID TO HAVE COLLAPSED IN JANUARY OF OH NINE WHICH IS JUST COMING UP TO NEARLY FOUR YEARS
tst2013.talkid1673_095 IN AN UNPRECEDENTED FIT OF GENEROSITY AND YOU HAVE TO BE VERY SUSPICIOUS ABOUT THESE PEOPLE IN AN UNPRECEDENTED AND I'M USING THAT WORD CAREFULLY UNPRECEDENTED FIT OF GENEROSITY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY SIGNED MADE A WRITTEN COMMITMENT TO REPAY ALL OF THE CREDITORS
tst2013.talkid1673_096 AND I CAN TELL YOU WITHOUT FEAR OF CONTRADICTION THAT HASN'T HAPPENED ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE PLANET
tst2013.talkid1673_097 LET'S UNDERSTAND BECAUSE WE LACK CONTEXT
tst2013.talkid1673_098 PEOPLE ARE TELLING US IT'S JUST LIKE WALL STREET IT'S NOT JUST LIKE WALL STREET
tst2013.talkid1673_099 TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO IS LIKE A PLACE WITH DIFFERENT LAWS OF PHYSICS OR BIOLOGY OR SOMETHING
tst2013.talkid1673_100 IT'S NOT JUST LIKE ANYWHERE
tst2013.talkid1673_101 IT'S NOT JUST LIKE ANYWHERE IT'S NOT JUST LIKE ANYWHERE
tst2013.talkid1673_102 HERE IS HERE AND OUT THERE IS OUT THERE OKAY
tst2013.talkid1673_103 I'M SERIOUS NOW
tst2013.talkid1673_104 LISTEN THEY'VE HAD BAILOUTS ON WALL STREET
tst2013.talkid1673_105 THEY'VE HAD BAILOUTS IN LONDON
tst2013.talkid1673_106 THEY'VE HAD BAILOUTS IN EUROPE
tst2013.talkid1673_107 IN AFRICA THEY'VE HAD BAILOUTS IN NIGERIA SIX OF THE MAJOR COMMERCIAL BANKS COLLAPSED AT THE SAME TIME AS OURS EH
tst2013.talkid1673_108 IT'S INTERESTING TO PARALLEL HOW THE NIGERIAN EXPERIENCE HAS HOW THEY'VE TREATED WITH IT AND THEY'VE TREATED IT VERY WELL COMPARED TO US
tst2013.talkid1673_109 NOWHERE ON THE PLANET HAVE ALL THE CREDITORS BEEN BAILED OUT IN EXCESS OF WHAT THEIR STATUTORY ENTITLEMENTS WERE
tst2013.talkid1673_110 ONLY HERE SO WHAT WAS THE REASON FOR THE GENEROSITY
tst2013.talkid1673_111 IS OUR GOVERNMENT THAT GENEROUS AND MAYBE THEY ARE
tst2013.talkid1673_112 LET'S LOOK AT IT LET'S LOOK INTO IT
tst2013.talkid1673_113 SO I STARTED DIGGING AND WRITING AND SO AND SO ON AND THAT WORK CAN BE FOUND MY PERSONAL WORK CAN BE FOUND AT AFRA RAYMOND DOT COM WHICH IS MY NAME
tst2013.talkid1673_114 IT'S A NOT FOR PROFIT BLOG THAT I RUN
tst2013.talkid1673_115 NOT AS POPULAR AS SOME OF THE OTHER PEOPLE BUT THERE YOU GO
tst2013.talkid1673_116 BUT THE POINT IS THAT THE BITTER EXPERIENCE OF SECTION THIRTY FOUR THAT PLOT TO PERVERT PARLIAMENT THAT BITTER EXPERIENCE THAT TOOK PLACE IN AUGUST WHEN WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE CELEBRATING OUR INDEPENDENCE GOING INTO SEPTEMBER FORCED ME TO CHECK MYSELF AND RECALCULATE MY BEARINGS AND TO GO BACK INTO SOME OF THE WORK SOME OF THE STUFF I'D WRITTEN AND SOME OF THE EXCHANGES I'D HAD WITH THE OFFICIALS TO SEE WHAT WAS REALLY WHAT
tst2013.talkid1673_117 AS WE SAY IN TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO WHO IS WHO AND WHAT IS WHAT
tst2013.talkid1673_118 OKAY WE WANT TO TRY TO RECALCULATE
tst2013.talkid1673_119 AND I MADE A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION APPLICATION IN MAY THIS YEAR TO THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE
tst2013.talkid1673_120 THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE IS THE NEXT TOWER OVER
tst2013.talkid1673_121 THIS IS THE OTHER CONTEXT
tst2013.talkid1673_122 THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE WE ARE TOLD IS SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT
tst2013.talkid1673_123 I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU THROUGH A WORKED EXAMPLE OF WHETHER THAT'S REALLY SO
tst2013.talkid1673_124 THE CENTRAL BANK IN WHICH WE STAND THIS MORNING IS IMMUNE FROM THE PROVISIONS OF THE OF THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT
tst2013.talkid1673_125 SO IN FACT YOU CAN'T ASK THEM ANYTHING AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER ANYTHING
tst2013.talkid1673_126 THAT IS THE LAW SINCE NINETEEN NINETY NINE
tst2013.talkid1673_127 SO I PLUNGED INTO THIS STRUGGLE AND I ASKED FOUR QUESTIONS
tst2013.talkid1673_128 AND I'LL RELATE THE QUESTIONS TO YOU IN THE SHORT FORM WITH THE REPLY SO YOU COULD UNDERSTAND AS I SAID WHERE WE ARE
tst2013.talkid1673_129 HERE IS NOT LIKE ANYWHERE ELSE
tst2013.talkid1673_130 QUESTION NUMBER ONE I ASKED TO SEE THE ACCOUNTS OF CL FINANCIAL AND IF YOU CAN'T SHOW ME THE ACCOUNTS THE MINISTER OF FINANCE IS MAKING STATEMENTS PASSING NEW LAWS AND GIVING SPEECHES AND SO ON
tst2013.talkid1673_131 WHAT ARE THE FIGURES HE'S RELYING ON
tst2013.talkid1673_132 IT'S LIKE THAT JOKE I WANT WHATEVER HE'S DRINKING
tst2013.talkid1673_133 AND THEY WROTE BACK AND SAID TO ME WELL WHAT DO YOU REALLY MEAN
tst2013.talkid1673_134 SO THEY HIT MY QUESTION WITH A QUESTION
tst2013.talkid1673_135 SECOND POINT I WANT TO SEE WHO ARE THE CREDITORS OF THE GROUP WHO HAVE BEEN REPAID
tst2013.talkid1673_136 LET ME PAUSE HERE TO POINT OUT TO YOU ALL THAT TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OF OUR MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT ON THIS
tst2013.talkid1673_137 THAT IS ABOUT THREE AND A HALF BILLION US DOLLARS COMING OUT OF A SMALL WE USED TO BE RESOURCE RICH CARIBBEAN COUNTRY OKAY
tst2013.talkid1673_138 AND I ASKED THE QUESTION WHO WAS GETTING THAT THREE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS
tst2013.talkid1673_139 AND I WANT TO PAUSE AGAIN TO BRING UP CONTEXT BECAUSE CONTEXT HELPS US TO GET CLARITY UNDERSTANDING THIS THING
tst2013.talkid1673_140 THERE'S A PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL WHO IS IN THE GOVERNMENT NOW
tst2013.talkid1673_141 THE NAME OF THE PERSON DOESN'T MATTER
tst2013.talkid1673_142 AND THAT PERSON MADE A CAREER OUT OF USING THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT TO ADVANCE HIS POLITICAL CAUSE
tst2013.talkid1673_143 OKAY HIS NAME ISN'T IMPORTANT
tst2013.talkid1673_144 I WOULDN'T DIGNIFY IT I'M ON A POINT
tst2013.talkid1673_145 THE POINT IS THAT PERSON MADE A CAREER OUT OF USING THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT TO ADVANCE HIS CAUSE
tst2013.talkid1673_146 AND THE MOST FAMOUS CASE WAS WHAT WE CAME TO CALL THE SECRET SCHOLARSHIP SCANDAL WHERE IN FACT THERE WAS ABOUT SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN GOVERNMENT MONEY THAT HAD BEEN DISBURSED IN A SERIES OF SCHOLARSHIPS AND THE SCHOLARSHIPS HADN'T BEEN ADVERTISED AND SO AND SO ON AND SO ON
tst2013.talkid1673_147 AND HE WAS ABLE TO GET THE COURT USING THAT ACT OF PARLIAMENT FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT TO RELEASE THE INFORMATION AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS EXCELLENT
tst2013.talkid1673_148 FANTASTIC
tst2013.talkid1673_149 BUT YOU SEE THE QUESTION IS THIS IF IT'S RIGHT AND PROPER FOR US TO USE THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT AND TO USE THE COURT TO FORCE A DISCLOSURE ABOUT SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN PUBLIC MONEY IT MUST BE RIGHT AND PROPER FOR US TO FORCE A DISCLOSURE ABOUT TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS
tst2013.talkid1673_150 YOU SEE BUT THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE THE PERMANENT SECRETARY OF THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE WROTE ME AND SAID TO ME THAT INFORMATION IS EXEMPT TOO
tst2013.talkid1673_151 YOU SEE THIS IS WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH OKAY
tst2013.talkid1673_152 THE THIRD THING I WILL TELL YOU IS THAT I ALSO ASKED FOR THE DIRECTORS OF CL FINANCIAL WHETHER IN FACT THEY WERE MAKING FILINGS UNDER OUR INTEGRITY IN PUBLIC LIFE ACT
tst2013.talkid1673_153 WE HAVE AN INTEGRITY IN PUBLIC LIFE ACT AS PART OF OUR FRAMEWORK SUPPOSED TO SAFEGUARD THE NATION'S INTEREST
tst2013.talkid1673_154 AND PUBLIC OFFICIALS ARE SUPPOSED TO FILE TO SAY WHAT IT IS THEY HAVE IN TERMS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
tst2013.talkid1673_155 AND OF COURSE I'VE SINCE DISCOVERED THAT THEY'RE NOT FILING AND IN FACT THE MINISTER OF FINANCE HAS NOT EVEN ASKED THEM TO FILE
tst2013.talkid1673_156 SO HERE WE HAVE IT WE HAVE A SITUATION WHERE THE BASIC SAFEGUARDS OF INTEGRITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY HAVE ALL BEEN DISCARDED
tst2013.talkid1673_157 I'VE ASKED THE QUESTION IN THE LEGAL AND REQUIRED FASHION
tst2013.talkid1673_158 IT'S BEEN IGNORED
tst2013.talkid1673_159 THE SORT OF THING THAT MOTIVATED US AROUND SECTION THIRTY FOUR WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT WE CAN'T FORGET IT
tst2013.talkid1673_160 I HAVE DEFINED THIS AS THE SINGLE LARGEST EXPENDITURE IN THE COUNTRY'S HISTORY
tst2013.talkid1673_161 IT'S ALSO THE SINGLE LARGEST EXAMPLE OF PUBLIC CORRUPTION ACCORDING TO THIS EQUATION
tst2013.talkid1673_162 AND THIS IS MY REALITY CHECK
tst2013.talkid1673_163 WHERE YOU HAVE AN EXPENDITURE OF PUBLIC MONEY AND IT IS WITHOUT ACCOUNTABILITY AND IT'S WITHOUT TRANSPARENCY IT WILL ALWAYS BE EQUAL TO CORRUPTION WHETHER YOU'RE IN RUSSIA OR NIGERIA OR ALASKA IT WILL ALWAYS BE EQUAL TO CORRUPTION AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DEALING WITH HERE
tst2013.talkid1673_164 I'M GOING TO CONTINUE THE WORK TO PRESS ON TO GET SOME RESOLUTION OF THOSE MATTERS AT THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE
tst2013.talkid1673_165 IF IT IS I HAVE TO GO TO COURT PERSONALLY I WILL DO THAT
tst2013.talkid1673_166 WE WILL CONTINUE TO PRESS ON
tst2013.talkid1673_167 WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITHIN JCC
tst2013.talkid1673_168 BUT I WANT TO STEP BACK FROM THE TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO CONTEXT AND BRING SOMETHING NEW TO THE TABLE IN TERMS OF AN INTERNATIONAL EXAMPLE
tst2013.talkid1673_169 WE HAD THE JOURNALIST REBECCA BROOKE SPEAKING ABOUT HER BATTLE AGAINST GOVERNMENT CORRUPTION AND SHE INTRODUCED ME TO THIS WEBSITE ALAVETELI DOT COM
tst2013.talkid1673_170 AND ALAVETELI DOT COM IS A WAY FOR US TO HAVE AN OPEN DATABASE FOR FREEDOM OF INFORMATION APPLICATIONS AND SPEAK WITH EACH OTHER
tst2013.talkid1673_171 I COULD SEE WHAT YOU'RE APPLYING FOR
tst2013.talkid1673_172 YOU COULD SEE WHAT I APPLIED FOR AND WHAT WHAT REPLIES I GOT
tst2013.talkid1673_173 WE CAN WORK ON IT TOGETHER WE NEED TO BUILD A COLLECTIVE DATABASE AND A COLLECTIVE UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE WE ARE TO GO TO THE NEXT POINT
tst2013.talkid1673_174 WE NEED TO INCREASE THE CONSCIOUSNESS
tst2013.talkid1673_175 THE FINAL THING I WANT TO SAY IS IN RELATION TO THIS ONE WHICH IS A LOVELY WEBSITE FROM INDIA CALLED I PAID A BRIBE DOT COM
tst2013.talkid1673_176 THEY HAVE INTERNATIONAL BRANCHES AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO TUNE INTO THIS ONE
tst2013.talkid1673_177 I PAID A BRIBE DOT COM IS REALLY IMPORTANT A GOOD ONE TO LOG ON TO AND SEE
tst2013.talkid1673_178 I'M GOING TO PAUSE THERE I'M GOING TO ASK YOU FOR YOUR COURAGE
tst2013.talkid1673_179 DISCARD THE FIRST MYTH IT IS A CRIME
tst2013.talkid1673_180 DISCARD THE SECOND MYTH IT IS A BIG THING
tst2013.talkid1673_181 IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM IT'S AN ECONOMIC CRIME
tst2013.talkid1673_182 AND LET US CONTINUE WORKING TOGETHER TO BETTERMENT IN THIS SITUATION STABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY IN OUR SOCIETY
tst2013.talkid1685_000 I LIVE IN SOUTH CENTRAL
tst2013.talkid1685_001 THIS IS SOUTH CENTRAL LIQUOR STORES FAST FOOD VACANT LOTS

tst2013.talkid1685_014 SO SO I I FIGURED THAT THE THE PROBLEM IS THE SOLUTION
tst2013.talkid1685_015 FOOD IS THE PROBLEM AND FOOD IS THE SOLUTION
tst2013.talkid1685_016 PLUS I GOT TIRED OF DRIVING FORTY FIVE MINUTES ROUND TRIP TO GET AN APPLE THAT WASN'T IMPREGNATED WITH PESTICIDE
tst2013.talkid1685_017 SO WHAT I DID I PLANTED A FOOD FOREST IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE
tst2013.talkid1685_018 IT WAS ON A STRIP OF LAND THAT WE CALL A PARKWAY
tst2013.talkid1685_019 IT'S LIKE A HUNDRED FIFTY FEET BY TEN FEET
tst2013.talkid1685_020 THING IS IT'S OWNED BY THE CITY
tst2013.talkid1685_021 BUT YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN IT
tst2013.talkid1685_022 SO I'M LIKE COOL I CAN DO WHATEVER THE HELL I WANT SINCE THIS IS MY RESPONSIBILITY AND I GOTTA MAINTAIN IT
tst2013.talkid1685_023 AND THIS IS HOW I DECIDED TO MAINTAIN IT
tst2013.talkid1685_024 SO ME AND MY GROUP LA GREEN GROUNDS WE GOT TOGETHER AND WE STARTED PLANTING MY FOOD FOREST FRUIT TREES YOU KNOW THE WHOLE NINE VEGETABLES
tst2013.talkid1685_025 WHAT WE DO WE'RE WE'RE A PAY IT FORWARD KIND OF GROUP WHERE IT'S COMPOSED OF LIKE GARDENERS FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE FROM ALL OVER THE CITY AND IT'S COMPLETELY VOLUNTEER AND EVERYTHING WE DO IS FREE
tst2013.talkid1685_026 AND AND THE GARDEN IT WAS BEAUTIFUL

tst2013.talkid1685_028 THE CITY CAME DOWN ON ME AND THEY AND BASICALLY GAVE ME A CITATION SAYING THAT I HAD TO REMOVE MY GARDEN WHICH THIS CITATION WAS TURNING INTO A WARRANT
tst2013.talkid1685_029 AND I'M LIKE COME ON REALLY

tst2013.talkid1685_039 THAT'S TWENTY CENTRAL PARKS
tst2013.talkid1685_040 THAT'S ENOUGH SPACE TO PLANT SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION TOMATO PLANTS
tst2013.talkid1685_041 WHY IN THE HELL WOULD THEY NOT OKAY THIS
tst2013.talkid1685_042 GROWING ONE PLANT WILL GIVE YOU A THOUSAND TEN THOUSAND SEEDS
tst2013.talkid1685_043 WHEN ONE DOLLAR'S WORTH OF OF GREEN BEANS WILL GIVE YOU LIKE SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS' WORTH OF PRODUCE
tst2013.talkid1685_044 IT'S LIKE MY IT'S MY GOSPEL WHEN I'M TELLING PEOPLE GROW YOUR OWN FOOD
tst2013.talkid1685_045 GROWING YOUR OWN FOOD IS LIKE PRINTING YOUR OWN MONEY
tst2013.talkid1685_046 SEE I HAVE A LEGACY IN SOUTH CENTRAL
tst2013.talkid1685_047 I I GREW UP THERE I RAISED MY SONS THERE
tst2013.talkid1685_048 AND I REFUSE TO BE A PART OF THIS MANUFACTURED REALITY THAT WAS MANUFACTURED FOR ME BY SOME OTHER PEOPLE AND I'M MANUFACTURING MY OWN REALITY
tst2013.talkid1685_049 SEE I'M AN ARTIST
tst2013.talkid1685_050 GARDENING IS MY GRAFFITI I GROW MY ART
tst2013.talkid1685_051 JUST LIKE A GRAFFITI ARTIST WHERE THEY BEAUTIFY WALLS ME I BEAUTIFY LAWNS PARKWAYS
tst2013.talkid1685_052 I USE THE GARDEN THE SOIL LIKE IT'S A PIECE OF CLOTH AND THE PLANTS AND THE AND THE TREES THAT'S MY EMBELLISHMENT FOR THAT CLOTH
tst2013.talkid1685_053 YOU'D BE SURPRISED WHAT WHAT WHAT THE SOIL COULD DO IF YOU LET IT BE YOUR CANVAS
tst2013.talkid1685_054 YOU JUST COULDN'T IMAGINE HOW AMAZING A SUNFLOWER IS AND HOW IT AFFECTS PEOPLE
tst2013.talkid1685_055 SO WHAT WHAT HAPPENED
tst2013.talkid1685_056 I HAVE WITNESSED MY GARDEN BECOME A TOOL FOR THE EDUCATION A TOOL FOR THE TRANSFORMATION OF MY NEIGHBORHOOD
tst2013.talkid1685_057 TO CHANGE THE COMMUNITY YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THE COMPOSITION OF THE SOIL
tst2013.talkid1685_058 WE ARE THE SOIL
tst2013.talkid1685_059 YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW KIDS ARE AFFECTED BY THIS
tst2013.talkid1685_060 GARDENING IS THE MOST THERAPEUTIC AND DEFIANT ACT YOU CAN DO ESPECIALLY IN THE INNER CITY
tst2013.talkid1685_061 PLUS YOU GET STRAWBERRIES
tst2013.talkid1685_062 I REMEMBER THIS TIME UM THERE WAS THIS MOTHER AND A DAUGHTER CAME IT WAS LIKE TEN THIRTY AT NIGHT AND THEY WERE IN MY YARD AND UM I CAME OUT AND THEY LOOKED SO ASHAMED
tst2013.talkid1685_063 SO I'M LIKE MAN IT MADE ME FEEL BAD THAT THEY WERE THERE AND I TOLD THEM YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS LIKE THIS
tst2013.talkid1685_064 THIS IS ON THE STREET FOR A REASON
tst2013.talkid1685_065 IT MADE ME FEEL ASHAMED TO SEE PEOPLE THAT WERE THIS CLOSE TO ME THAT WERE HUNGRY AND THIS ONLY THIS ONLY REINFORCED WHY I DO THIS AND PEOPLE ASKED ME FIN AREN'T YOU AFRAID PEOPLE ARE GOING TO STEAL YOUR FOOD
tst2013.talkid1685_066 AND I'M LIKE HELL NO I AIN'T AFRAID THEY'RE GONNA STEAL IT
tst2013.talkid1685_067 THAT'S WHY IT'S ON THE STREET
tst2013.talkid1685_068 THAT'S THE WHOLE IDEA
tst2013.talkid1685_069 I WANT THEM TO TAKE IT BUT AT THE SAME TIME I WANT THEM TO TAKE BACK THEIR HEALTH
tst2013.talkid1685_070 THERE'S ANOTHER TIME WHEN I WHEN I PUT A GARDEN IN THIS IN THIS HOMELESS SHELTER IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES
tst2013.talkid1685_071 THESE ARE THE GUYS THEY HELPED ME UNLOAD THE TRUCK
tst2013.talkid1685_072 IT WAS COOL AND THEY JUST SHARED THE STORIES ABOUT HOW THIS AFFECTED THEM AND HOW THEY USED TO PLANT WITH THEIR MOTHER AND THEIR GRANDMOTHER AND IT WAS JUST COOL TO SEE HOW THIS CHANGED THEM IF IT WAS ONLY FOR THAT ONE MOMENT
tst2013.talkid1685_073 SO GREEN GROUNDS HAS GONE ON TO PLANT MAYBE LIKE TWENTY GARDENS
tst2013.talkid1685_074 WE'VE HAD LIKE PEOPLE LIKE FIFTY PEOPLE COME TO OUR DIG INS AND PARTICIPATE AND IT'S ALL VOLUNTEERS
tst2013.talkid1685_075 IF KIDS GROW KALE KIDS EAT KALE
tst2013.talkid1685_076 IF THEY GROW TOMATOES THEY EAT TOMATOES
tst2013.talkid1685_077 BUT WHEN NONE OF THIS IS IS IS PRESENTED TO THEM IF THEY'RE NOT SHOWN HOW FOOD AFFECTS THE MIND AND THE BODY THEY BLINDLY EAT WHATEVER THE HELL YOU PUT IN FRONT OF THEM
tst2013.talkid1685_078 I I I SEE YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEY WANT TO WORK BUT THEY'RE IN THIS THING WHERE THEY'RE CAUGHT UP I SEE KIDS OF COLOR AND THEY'RE JUST ON THIS TRACK THAT'S DESIGNED FOR THEM UH THAT LEADS THEM TO NOWHERE
tst2013.talkid1685_079 SO WITH WITH GARDENING I SEE AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE WE CAN TRAIN THESE KIDS TO TO TO TAKE OVER THEIR COMMUNITIES TO TO HAVE A SUSTAINABLE LIFE
tst2013.talkid1685_080 AND AND AND WHEN WE DO THIS WHO KNOWS
tst2013.talkid1685_081 WE MIGHT HAVE WE MIGHT PRODUCE THE NEXT GEORGE WASHINGTON CARVER
tst2013.talkid1685_082 BUT IF WE DON'T CHANGE THE COMPOSITION OF THE SOIL WE WILL NEVER DO THIS
tst2013.talkid1685_083 NOW THIS IS THIS IS ONE OF MY PLANS THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO DO
tst2013.talkid1685_084 I WANT TO PLANT A WHOLE BLOCK OF GARDENS WHERE PEOPLE CAN SHARE IN THE FOOD IN THE SAME BLOCK
tst2013.talkid1685_085 I WANT TO TAKE SHIPPING CONTAINERS AND TURN THEM INTO HEALTHY CAFES
tst2013.talkid1685_086 NOW DON'T GET ME WRONG
tst2013.talkid1685_087 I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT NO FREE SHIT BECAUSE FREE IS NOT SUSTAINABLE
tst2013.talkid1685_088 THE FUNNY THING ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY YOU HAVE TO SUSTAIN IT
tst2013.talkid1685_089 WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS PUTTING PEOPLE TO WORK AND GETTING GETTING KIDS OFF THE STREET AND LETTING THEM KNOW THE JOY THE PRIDE AND THE HONOR IN GROWING YOUR OWN FOOD OPENING FARMER'S MARKETS
tst2013.talkid1685_090 SO SO WHAT I WANT TO DO HERE WE GOTTA MAKE THIS SEXY

tst2013.talkid1685_098 PEACE THANK YOU
tst2013.talkid1685_099 THANK YOU
tst2013.talkid1694_000 WHEN I WAS LITTLE I THOUGHT MY COUNTRY WAS THE BEST ON THE PLANET AND I GREW UP SINGING A SONG CALLED NOTHING TO ENVY
tst2013.talkid1694_001 AND I WAS VERY PROUD
tst2013.talkid1694_002 IN SCHOOL WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME STUDYING THE HISTORY OF KIM IL SUNG BUT WE NEVER LEARNED MUCH ABOUT THE OUTSIDE WORLD EXCEPT THAT AMERICA SOUTH KOREA JAPAN ARE THE ENEMIES
tst2013.talkid1694_003 ALTHOUGH I OFTEN WONDERED ABOUT THE OUTSIDE WORLD I THOUGHT I WOULD SPEND ENTIRE MY LIFE IN NORTH KOREA UNTIL EVERYTHING SUDDENLY CHANGED
tst2013.talkid1694_004 WHEN I WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD I SAW MY FIRST PUBLIC EXECUTION BUT I THOUGHT MY LIFE IN NORTH KOREA WAS NORMAL
tst2013.talkid1694_005 MY FAMILY WAS NOT POOR AND MYSELF HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED HUNGER
tst2013.talkid1694_006 BUT ONE DAY IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE MY MOM BROUGHT HOME A LETTER FROM A COWORKER'S SISTER
tst2013.talkid1694_007 IT READ WHEN YOU READ THIS ALL FIVE FAMILY MEMBERS WILL NOT EXIST IN THIS WORLD BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T EATEN FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS
tst2013.talkid1694_008 WE ARE LYING ON THE FLOOR TOGETHER AND OUR BODIES ARE SO WEAK WE ARE READY TO DIE
tst2013.talkid1694_009 I WAS SO SHOCKED
tst2013.talkid1694_010 THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I HEARD THAT PEOPLE IN MY COUNTRY WERE SUFFERING
tst2013.talkid1694_011 SOON AFTER WHEN I WAS WALKING PAST A TRAIN STATION I SAW SOMETHING TERRIBLE THAT I CAN'T ERASE FROM MY MEMORY
tst2013.talkid1694_012 A LIFELESS WOMAN WAS LYING ON THE GROUND WHILE AN EMACIATED CHILD IN HER ARMS JUST STARED HELPLESSLY AT HIS MOTHER'S FACE
tst2013.talkid1694_013 BUT NOBODY HELPED THEM BECAUSE THEY WERE SO FOCUSED ON TAKING CARE OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES
tst2013.talkid1694_014 A HUGE FAMINE HIT NORTH KOREA IN THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES
tst2013.talkid1694_015 ULTIMATELY MORE THAN A MILLION NORTH KOREANS DIED DURING THE FAMINE AND MANY ONLY SURVIVED BY EATING GRASS BUGS AND TREE BARK
tst2013.talkid1694_016 POWER OUTAGES ALSO BECAME MORE AND MORE FREQUENT SO EVERYTHING AROUND ME WAS COMPLETELY DARK AT NIGHT EXCEPT FOR THE SEA OF LIGHTS IN CHINA JUST ACROSS THE RIVER FROM MY HOME
tst2013.talkid1694_017 I ALWAYS WONDERED WHY THEY HAD LIGHTS BUT WE DIDN'T
tst2013.talkid1694_018 THIS IS A SATELLITE PICTURE SHOWING NORTH KOREA AT NIGHT COMPARED TO NEIGHBORS
tst2013.talkid1694_019 THIS IS THE AMROK RIVER WHICH SERVES AS A PART OF THE BORDER BETWEEN NORTH KOREA AND CHINA
tst2013.talkid1694_020 AS YOU CAN SEE THE RIVER CAN BE VERY NARROW AT CERTAIN POINTS ALLOWING NORTH KOREANS TO SECRETLY CROSS
tst2013.talkid1694_021 BUT MANY DIE
tst2013.talkid1694_022 SOMETIMES I SAW DEAD BODIES FLOATING DOWN THE RIVER
tst2013.talkid1694_023 I CAN'T REVEAL MANY DETAILS HOW I LEFT NORTH KOREA BUT I ONLY CAN SAY THAT DURING THE UGLY YEARS OF THE FAMINE I WAS SENT TO CHINA TO LIVE WITH DISTANT RELATIVES
tst2013.talkid1694_024 BUT I ONLY THOUGHT THAT I WOULD BE SEPARATED FROM MY FAMILY FOR A SHORT TIME
tst2013.talkid1694_025 I COULD HAVE NEVER IMAGINED THAT IT WOULD TAKE FOURTEEN YEARS TO LIVE TOGETHER
tst2013.talkid1694_026 IN CHINA IT WAS HARD LIVING AS A YOUNG GIRL WITHOUT MY FAMILY
tst2013.talkid1694_027 I HAD NO IDEAS WHAT LIFE WAS GOING TO BE LIKE AS A NORTH KOREAN REFUGEE BUT I SOON LEARNED IT'S NOT ONLY EXTREMELY DIFFICULT IT'S ALSO VERY DANGEROUS SINCE NORTH KOREAN REFUGEES ARE CONSIDERED IN CHINA AS ILLEGAL MIGRANTS
tst2013.talkid1694_028 SO I WAS LIVING IN CONSTANT FEAR THAT MY IDENTITY COULD BE REVEALED AND I WOULD BE REPATRIATED TO A HORRIBLE FATE BACK IN NORTH KOREA
tst2013.talkid1694_029 ONE DAY MY WORST NIGHTMARE CAME TRUE WHEN I WAS CAUGHT BY THE CHINESE POLICE AND BROUGHT TO THE POLICE STATION FOR INTERROGATION
tst2013.talkid1694_030 SOMEONE HAD ACCUSED ME OF BEING NORTH KOREAN SO THEY TESTED MY CHINESE LANGUAGE ABILITIES AND ASKED ME TONS OF QUESTIONS
tst2013.talkid1694_031 I WAS SO SCARED I THOUGHT MY HEART WAS GOING TO EXPLODE
tst2013.talkid1694_032 IF ANYTHING SEEMED UNNATURAL I COULD BE IMPRISONED AND REPATRIATED
tst2013.talkid1694_033 I THOUGHT MY LIFE WAS OVER BUT I MANAGED TO CONTROL ALL THE EMOTIONS INSIDE ME AND ANSWER THE QUESTIONS
tst2013.talkid1694_034 AFTER THEY FINISHED QUESTIONING ME ONE OFFICIAL SAID TO ANOTHER THIS WAS A FALSE REPORT
tst2013.talkid1694_035 SHE'S NOT NORTH KOREAN
tst2013.talkid1694_036 AND THEY LET ME GO IT WAS A MIRACLE
tst2013.talkid1694_037 SOME NORTH KOREANS IN CHINA SEEK ASYLUM IN FOREIGN EMBASSIES BUT MANY CAN BE CAUGHT BY THE CHINESE POLICE AND REPATRIATED
tst2013.talkid1694_038 THESE GIRLS WERE SO LUCKY
tst2013.talkid1694_039 EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE CAUGHT THEY WERE EVENTUALLY RELEASED AFTER HEAVY INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE
tst2013.talkid1694_040 THESE NORTH KOREANS WERE NOT SO LUCKY
tst2013.talkid1694_041 EVERY YEAR COUNTLESS NORTH KOREANS ARE CAUGHT IN CHINA AND REPATRIATED TO NORTH KOREA WHERE THEY CAN BE TORTURED IMPRISONED OR PUBLICLY EXECUTED
tst2013.talkid1694_042 EVEN THOUGH I WAS REALLY FORTUNATE TO GET OUT MANY OTHER NORTH KOREANS HAVE NOT BEEN SO LUCKY
tst2013.talkid1694_043 IT'S TRAGIC THAT NORTH KOREANS HAVE TO HIDE THEIR IDENTITIES AND STRUGGLE SO HARD JUST TO SURVIVE
tst2013.talkid1694_044 EVEN AFTER LEARNING A NEW LANGUAGE AND GETTING A JOB THEIR WHOLE WORLD CAN BE TURNED UPSIDE DOWN IN AN INSTANT
tst2013.talkid1694_045 THAT'S WHY AFTER TEN YEARS OF HIDING MY IDENTITY I DECIDED TO RISK GOING TO SOUTH KOREA AND I STARTED A NEW LIFE YET AGAIN
tst2013.talkid1694_046 SETTLING DOWN IN SOUTH KOREA WAS A LOT MORE CHALLENGING THAN I HAD EXPECTED
tst2013.talkid1694_047 ENGLISH WAS SO IMPORTANT IN SOUTH KOREA SO I HAD TO START LEARNING MY THIRD LANGUAGE
tst2013.talkid1694_048 ALSO I REALIZED THERE WAS A WIDE GAP BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH
tst2013.talkid1694_049 WE ARE ALL KOREAN BUT INSIDE WE HAVE BECOME VERY DIFFERENT DUE TO SIXTY SEVEN YEARS OF DIVISION
tst2013.talkid1694_050 I EVEN WENT THROUGH AN IDENTITY CRISIS
tst2013.talkid1694_051 AM I SOUTH KOREAN OR NORTH KOREAN
tst2013.talkid1694_052 WHERE AM I FROM WHO AM I
tst2013.talkid1694_053 SUDDENLY THERE WAS NO COUNTRY I COULD PROUDLY CALL MY OWN
tst2013.talkid1694_054 EVEN THOUGH ADJUSTING TO LIFE IN SOUTH KOREA WAS NOT EASY I MADE A PLAN
tst2013.talkid1694_055 I STARTED STUDYING FOR THE UNIVERSITY ENTRANCE EXAM
tst2013.talkid1694_056 JUST AS I WAS STARTING TO GET USED TO MY NEW LIFE I RECEIVED A SHOCKING PHONE CALL
tst2013.talkid1694_057 THE NORTH KOREAN AUTHORITIES INTERCEPTED SOME MONEY THAT I SENT TO MY FAMILY AND AS A PUNISHMENT MY FAMILY WAS GOING TO BE FORCIBLY REMOVED TO A DESOLATE LOCATION IN THE COUNTRYSIDE
tst2013.talkid1694_058 THEY HAD TO GET OUT QUICKLY SO I STARTED PLANNING HOW TO HELP THEM ESCAPE
tst2013.talkid1694_059 NORTH KOREANS HAVE TO TRAVEL INCREDIBLE DISTANCES ON THE PATH TO FREEDOM
tst2013.talkid1694_060 IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CROSS THE BORDER BETWEEN NORTH KOREA AND SOUTH KOREA SO IRONICALLY I TOOK A FLIGHT BACK TO CHINA AND I HEADED TOWARD THE NORTH KOREAN BORDER
tst2013.talkid1694_061 SINCE MY FAMILY COULDN'T SPEAK CHINESE I HAD TO GUIDE THEM SOMEHOW THROUGH MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND MILES IN CHINA AND THEN INTO SOUTHEAST ASIA
tst2013.talkid1694_062 THE JOURNEY BY BUS TOOK ONE WEEK AND WE WERE ALMOST CAUGHT SEVERAL TIMES
tst2013.talkid1694_063 ONE TIME OUR BUS WAS STOPPED AND BOARDED BY A CHINESE POLICE OFFICER
tst2013.talkid1694_064 HE TOOK EVERYONE'S ID CARDS AND HE STARTED ASKING THEM QUESTIONS
tst2013.talkid1694_065 SINCE MY FAMILY COULDN'T UNDERSTAND CHINESE I THOUGHT MY FAMILY WAS GOING TO BE ARRESTED
tst2013.talkid1694_066 AS THE CHINESE OFFICER APPROACHED MY FAMILY I IMPULSIVELY STOOD UP AND I TOLD HIM THAT THESE ARE DEAF AND DUMB PEOPLE THAT I WAS CHAPERONING
tst2013.talkid1694_067 HE LOOKED AT ME SUSPICIOUSLY BUT HE LUCKILY HE BELIEVED ME
tst2013.talkid1694_068 WE MADE IT ALL THE WAY TO THE BORDER OF LAOS BUT I HAD TO SPEND ALMOST ALL MY MONEY TO BRIBE THE BORDER GUARDS IN LAOS
tst2013.talkid1694_069 BUT EVEN AFTER WE GOT PAST THE BORDER MY FAMILY WAS ARRESTED AND JAILED FOR ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSING
tst2013.talkid1694_070 AFTER I PAID THE FINE AND BRIBE MY FAMILY WAS RELEASED IN ONE MONTH BUT SOON AFTER MY FAMILY WAS ARRESTED AND JAILED AGAIN IN THE CAPITAL OF LAOS
tst2013.talkid1694_071 THIS WAS ONE OF THE LOWEST POINTS IN MY LIFE
tst2013.talkid1694_072 I DID EVERYTHING TO GET MY FAMILY GET TO FREEDOM AND WE CAME SO CLOSE BUT MY FAMILY WAS THROWN IN JAIL JUST A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE SOUTH KOREAN EMBASSY
tst2013.talkid1694_073 I WENT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE IMMIGRATION OFFICE AND THE POLICE STATION DESPERATELY TRYING TO GET MY FAMILY OUT BUT I DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY A BRIBE OR FINE ANYMORE
tst2013.talkid1694_074 I LOST ALL HOPE
tst2013.talkid1694_075 AT THAT MOMENT I HEARD ONE MAN'S VOICE ASK ME WHAT'S WRONG
tst2013.talkid1694_076 I WAS SO SURPRISED THAT A TOTAL STRANGER CARED ENOUGH TO ASK
tst2013.talkid1694_077 IN MY BROKEN ENGLISH AND WITH A DICTIONARY I EXPLAINED THE SITUATION AND WITHOUT HESITATING THE MAN WENT TO THE ATM AND HE PAID THE REST OF THE MONEY FOR MY FAMILY AND TWO OTHER NORTH KOREANS TO GET OUT OF JAIL
tst2013.talkid1694_078 I THANKED HIM WITH ALL MY HEART AND I ASKED HIM WHY ARE YOU HELPING ME
tst2013.talkid1694_079 I'M NOT HELPING YOU HE SAID
tst2013.talkid1694_080 I'M HELPING THE NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE
tst2013.talkid1694_081 I REALIZED THAT THIS WAS A SYMBOLIC MOMENT IN MY LIFE
tst2013.talkid1694_082 THE KIND STRANGER SYMBOLIZED NEW HOPE FOR ME AND THE NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE WHEN WE NEEDED IT MOST AND HE SHOWED ME THE KINDNESS OF STRANGERS AND THE SUPPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ARE TRULY THE RAYS OF HOPE WE NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE NEED
tst2013.talkid1694_083 EVENTUALLY AFTER OUR LONG JOURNEY MY FAMILY AND I WERE REUNITED IN SOUTH KOREA BUT GETTING TO FREEDOM IS ONLY HALF THE BATTLE
tst2013.talkid1694_084 MANY NORTH KOREANS ARE SEPARATED FROM THEIR FAMILIES AND WHEN THEY ARRIVE IN A NEW COUNTRY THEY START WITH LITTLE OR NO MONEY
tst2013.talkid1694_085 SO WE CAN BENEFIT FROM THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FOR EDUCATION ENGLISH LANGUAGE TRAINING JOB TRAINING AND MORE
tst2013.talkid1694_086 WE CAN ALSO ACT AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN THE PEOPLE INSIDE NORTH KOREA AND THE OUTSIDE WORLD BECAUSE MANY OF US STAY IN CONTACT WITH FAMILY MEMBERS STILL INSIDE AND WE SEND INFORMATION AND MONEY THAT IS HELPING TO CHANGE NORTH KOREA FROM INSIDE
tst2013.talkid1694_087 I'VE BEEN SO LUCKY RECEIVED SO MUCH HELP AND INSPIRATION IN MY LIFE SO I WANT TO HELP GIVE ASPIRING NORTH KOREANS A CHANCE TO PROSPER WITH INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT
tst2013.talkid1694_088 I'M CONFIDENT THAT YOU WILL SEE MORE AND MORE NORTH KOREANS SUCCEEDING ALL OVER THE WORLD INCLUDING THE TED STAGE
tst2013.talkid1694_089 THANK YOU
tst2013.talkid1699_000 THIS IS WHERE I LIVE I LIVE IN KENYA AT THE SOUTH PARTS OF THE NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK
tst2013.talkid1699_001 THOSE ARE MY DAD'S COWS AT THE BACK AND BEHIND THE COWS THAT'S THE NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK
tst2013.talkid1699_002 NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK IS NOT FENCED IN THE SOUTH WIDELY WHICH MEANS WILD ANIMALS LIKE ZEBRAS MIGRATE OUT OF THE PARK FREELY
tst2013.talkid1699_003 SO PREDATORS LIKE LIONS FOLLOW THEM AND THIS IS WHAT THEY DO
tst2013.talkid1699_004 THEY KILL OUR LIVESTOCK
tst2013.talkid1699_005 THIS IS ONE OF THE COWS WHICH WAS KILLED AT NIGHT AND I JUST WOKE UP IN THE THE MORNING AND I FOUND IT DEAD AND I FELT SO BAD BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY BULL WE HAD
tst2013.talkid1699_006 MY COMMUNITY THE MAASAI WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAME FROM HEAVEN WITH ALL OUR ANIMALS AND ALL THE LAND FOR HERDING THEM AND THAT'S WHY WE VALUE THEM SO MUCH
tst2013.talkid1699_007 SO I GREW UP HATING LIONS SO MUCH
tst2013.talkid1699_008 THE MORANS ARE THE WARRIORS WHO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITY AND THE LIVESTOCK AND THEY'RE ALSO UPSET ABOUT THIS PROBLEM
tst2013.talkid1699_009 SO THEY KILL THE LIONS
tst2013.talkid1699_010 IT'S ONE OF THE SIX LIONS WHICH WERE KILLED IN NAIROBI
tst2013.talkid1699_011 AND I THINK THIS IS WHY THE NAIROBI NATIONAL PARK LIONS ARE FEW
tst2013.talkid1699_012 SO A BOY FROM SIX TO NINE YEARS OLD IN MY COMMUNITY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS DAD'S COWS AND THAT'S THE SAME THING WHICH HAPPENED TO ME
tst2013.talkid1699_013 SO I HAD TO FIND A WAY OF SOLVING THIS PROBLEM
tst2013.talkid1699_014 AND THE FIRST IDEA I GOT WAS TO USE FIRE BECAUSE I THOUGHT LIONS WERE SCARED OF FIRE
tst2013.talkid1699_015 BUT I CAME TO REALIZE THAT THAT DIDN'T REALLY HELP BECAUSE IT WAS EVEN HELPING THE LIONS TO SEE THROUGH THE COWSHED
tst2013.talkid1699_016 SO I DIDN'T GIVE UP I CONTINUED
tst2013.talkid1699_017 AND A SECOND IDEA I GOT WAS TO USE A SCARECROW
tst2013.talkid1699_018 I WAS TRYING TO TRICK THE LIONS THAT I WAS STANDING NEAR THE COWSHED
tst2013.talkid1699_019 BUT LIONS ARE VERY CLEVER
tst2013.talkid1699_020 THEY WILL COME THE FIRST DAY AND THEY SEE THE SCARECROW AND THEY GO BACK BUT THE SECOND DAY THEY'LL COME AND THEY SAY THIS THING IS NOT MOVING HERE IT'S ALWAYS HERE
tst2013.talkid1699_021 SO HE JUMPS IN AND KILLS THE ANIMALS
tst2013.talkid1699_022 SO ONE NIGHT I WAS WALKING AROUND THE COWSHED WITH A TORCH AND THAT DAY THE LIONS DIDN'T COME
tst2013.talkid1699_023 AND I DISCOVERED THAT LIONS ARE AFRAID OF A MOVING LIGHT
tst2013.talkid1699_024 SO I HAD AN IDEA
tst2013.talkid1699_025 SINCE I WAS A SMALL BOY I USED TO WORK IN MY ROOM FOR THE WHOLE DAY AND I EVEN TOOK APART MY MOM'S NEW RADIO AND THAT DAY SHE ALMOST KILLED ME BUT BUT I LEARNED A LOT ABOUT ELECTRONICS
tst2013.talkid1699_026 SO I GOT AN OLD CAR BATTERY AN INDICATOR BOX IT'S A SMALL DEVICE FOUND IN A MOTORCYCLE AND IT HELPS MOTORISTS WHEN THEY WANT TO TURN RIGHT OR LEFT IT BLINKS
tst2013.talkid1699_027 AND I GOT A SWITCH WHERE I CAN SWITCH ON THE LIGHTS ON AND OFF
tst2013.talkid1699_028 AND THAT'S A SMALL TORCH FROM A BROKEN FLASHLIGHT
tst2013.talkid1699_029 SO I SET UP EVERYTHING
tst2013.talkid1699_030 AS YOU CAN SEE THE SOLAR PANEL CHARGES THE BATTERY AND THE BATTERY SUPPLIES THE POWER TO THE SMALL INDICATOR BOX I CALL IT A TRANSFORMER
tst2013.talkid1699_031 AND THE INDICATOR BOX MAKES THE LIGHTS TO FLASH
tst2013.talkid1699_032 AS YOU CAN SEE THE BULBS FACE OUTSIDE BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE LIONS COME FROM
tst2013.talkid1699_033 AND THAT'S HOW IT LOOKS TO LIONS WHEN THEY COME AT NIGHT
tst2013.talkid1699_034 THE LIGHTS FLASH AND TRICK THE LIONS THAT I WAS WALKING AROUND THE COWSHED BUT I WAS SLEEPING IN MY BED
tst2013.talkid1699_035 THANKS
tst2013.talkid1699_036 SO I SET IT UP IN MY HOME TWO YEARS AGO AND SINCE THEN WE HAVE NEVER EXPERIENCED ANY PROBLEM WITH LIONS
tst2013.talkid1699_037 AND MY NEIGHBORING HOMES HEARD ABOUT THIS IDEA
tst2013.talkid1699_038 ONE OF THEM WAS THIS GRANDMOTHER
tst2013.talkid1699_039 SHE HAD A LOT OF HER ANIMALS BEING KILLED BY LIONS AND SHE ASKED ME IF I COULD PUT THE LIGHTS FOR HER
tst2013.talkid1699_040 AND I SAID YES
tst2013.talkid1699_041 SO I PUT THE LIGHTS YOU CAN SEE AT THE BACK THOSE ARE THE LION LIGHTS
tst2013.talkid1699_042 SINCE NOW I'VE SET UP SEVEN HOMES AROUND MY COMMUNITY AND THEY'RE REALLY WORKING
tst2013.talkid1699_043 AND MY IDEA IS ALSO BEING USED NOW ALL OVER KENYA FOR SCARING OTHER PREDATORS LIKE HYENAS LEOPARDS AND ALSO IT'S ALSO BEING USED TO SCARE ELEPHANTS AWAY FROM PEOPLE'S FARMS
tst2013.talkid1699_044 BECAUSE OF THIS INVENTION I WAS LUCKY TO GET A SCHOLARSHIP IN ONE OF THE BEST SCHOOLS IN KENYA BROOKHOUSE INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL AND I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS
tst2013.talkid1699_045 MY NEW SCHOOL NOW IS COMING IN AND HELPING BY FUNDRAISING AND CREATING AN AWARENESS
tst2013.talkid1699_046 I EVEN TOOK BACK MY FRIENDS TO MY COMMUNITY AND WE'RE INSTALLING THE LIGHTS TO THE HOMES WHICH DON'T HAVE AND I'M TEACHING THEM HOW TO PUT THEM
tst2013.talkid1699_047 SO ONE YEAR AGO I WAS JUST A BOY IN THE SAVANNA GRASSLAND HERDING MY FATHER'S COWS AND I USED TO SEE PLANES FLYING OVER AND I TOLD MYSELF THAT ONE DAY I'LL BE THERE INSIDE
tst2013.talkid1699_048 AND HERE I AM TODAY
tst2013.talkid1699_049 I GOT A A CHANCE TO COME BY PLANE FOR MY FIRST TIME FOR TED
tst2013.talkid1699_050 SO MY BIG DREAM IS TO BECOME AN AIRCRAFT ENGINEER AND PILOT WHEN I GROW UP
tst2013.talkid1699_051 I USED TO HATE LIONS BUT NOW BECAUSE MY INVENTION IS SAVING MY FATHER'S COWS AND THE LIONS WE ARE ABLE TO STAY WITH THE LIONS WITHOUT ANY CONFLICT
tst2013.talkid1699_052 ASHÃª OLÃªN IT MEANS IN MY LANGUAGE THANK YOU VERY MUCH
tst2013.talkid1699_053 YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW EXCITING IT IS TO HEAR A STORY LIKE YOURS
tst2013.talkid1699_054 SO YOU GOT THIS SCHOLARSHIP YEP
tst2013.talkid1699_055 YOU'RE WORKING ON OTHER ELECTRICAL INVENTIONS
tst2013.talkid1699_056 WHAT'S THE NEXT ONE ON YOUR LIST
tst2013.talkid1699_057 MY NEXT INVENTION IS I WANT TO MAKE AN ELECTRIC FENCE ELECTRIC FENCE
tst2013.talkid1699_058 BUT I KNOW ELECTRIC FENCES ARE ALREADY INVENTED BUT I WANT TO MAKE MINE
tst2013.talkid1699_059 YOU ALREADY TRIED IT ONCE RIGHT AND YOU I TRIED IT BEFORE BUT I STOPPED BECAUSE IT GAVE ME A SHOCK
